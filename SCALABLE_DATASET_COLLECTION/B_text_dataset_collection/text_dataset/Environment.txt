John Tlumacki  The Boston Globe via Getty Images More than 30,000 small dams currently block river tributaries from Maine to Maryland. New initiatives to remove them are aimed at restoring natural flows, improving habitat for aquatic life, and reopening thousands of river miles to migratory fish, from shad to American eels. By Lela Nargi  February 4, 2025 The glass eels, 3 inches long with skin so translucent it reveals the beating of their tiny hearts, writhe with unexpected strength in the palm of a hand. For a year they have ridden the tides from their hatching site, in the Sargasso Sea, to the mouth of upstate New Yorks Saw Kill Creek, a narrow tributary of the Hudson River. Thats where a fyke net set out by biologists, counting migratory American eels as they seek clear and flowing creeks in which to mature, captures them. Although not considered endangered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, American eels have for decades been tallied at historically low numbers throughout the Northeastern United States, the most heavily dammed region in the nation. Fishing regulators consider their stocks depleted. But theyre not the only species in trouble here. Alewife and blueback herring, shad, shortnose and Atlantic sturgeon, and Atlantic salmon are all on the decline in Northeastern river systems. In response, a range of government agencies, private landowners, and environmental groups have been collaborating to restore these populations  by removing the dams that block their passage. Although dam removals have been happening since 1912, the vast majority have occurred since the mid-2010s, and they have picked up steam since the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, which provided funding for such projects. To date, 806 Northeastern dams have come down, with hundreds more in the pipeline. Across the country, 2023 was a watershed year, with a total of 80 dam removals. Says Andrew Fisk, Northeast regional director of the nonprofit American Rivers, The increasing intensity and frequency of storm events, and the dramatically reduced sizes of our migratory fish populations, are accelerating our efforts. Dam removals in the Northeast dont generate the same media attention as massive takedowns on West Coast rivers, like the Klamath or the Elwha. Thats because most of these structures are comparatively miniscule, built in the 19th century to form ponds and to power grist, textile, paper, saw, and other types of mills as the region developed into an industrial powerhouse.

They may be small to humans, but to the fish that cant get past them theyre just as big as a Klamath River dam, says Maddie Feaster, habitat restoration project manager for the environmental organization Riverkeeper, based in Ossining, New York. From Maryland and Pennsylvania up to Maine, there are 31,213 inventoried dams, more than 4,000 of which sit within the 13,400-square-mile Hudson River watershed alone. For generations theyve degraded habitat and altered downstream hydrology and sediment flows, creating warm, stagnant, low-oxygen pools that trigger algal blooms and favor invasive species. The dams inhibit fish passage, too, which is why the biologists at the mouth of the Saw Kill transported their glass eels past the first of three Saw Kill dams after counting them. Dams cumulatively disconnect a river, making individually isolated environments, says Katie Schmidt, associate director of American Rivers national dam removal program. The consequences for aquatic species can be enormous. Especially as the region warms, if youre a fish thats trapped below a dam, there might be nice cold water a mile up that stream, says Brian Yellen, Massachusetts state geologist. But if you cant get up it, that population is doomed. Left The Saw Kill Creek dam in Red Hook, New York. Right A glass eel found in the nearby Quassaick Creek. Lela Nargi Stan Honda  AFP via Getty Images Jeremy Dietrich, an aquatic ecologist at the New York State Water Resources Institute, monitors dam sites both pre- and post-removal. Environments upstream of an intact dam, he explains, are dominated by midges, aquatic worms, small crustaceans, organisms you typically might find in a pond. In 2017 and 2018 assessments of recent Hudson River dam removals, some of which also included riverbank restorations to further enhance habitat for native species, he found improved water quality and more populous communities of beetles, mayflies, and caddisflies, which are more sensitive to environmental perturbation, and thus used as bioindicators, he says. You have this big polarity of ecological conditions, because the barrier has severed the natural connectivity of the system. After removal, we generally see streams recover to a point where we didnt even know there was a dam there. American Rivers estimates that 85 percent of U.S. dams are unnecessary at best and pose risks to public safety at worst, should they collapse and flood downstream communities. The nonprofit has been involved with roughly 1,000 removals across the country, 38 of them since 2018. This effort was boosted by 800 million from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. But states will likely need to contribute more of their own funding should the Trump administration claw back unspent money, and organizations involved in dam removal are now scrambling to assess the potential impact to their work. Enthusiasm for such projects is on the upswing among some dam owners  whether states, municipalities, or private landholders. Pennsylvania alone has taken out more than 390 dams since 1912  107 of them between 2015 and 2023  none higher than 16 feet high. Individual property owners say I own a dam, and my insurance company is telling me I have a liability, says Fisk. Dams in disrepair may release toxic sediments that potentially threaten both human health and wildlife, and low-head dams, over which water flows continuously, churn up recirculating currents that trap and drown 50 people a year in the U.S. In a major reversal, the World Bank is backing mega dams. Read more. Numerous studies show that dam removals improve aquatic fish passage, water quality, watershed resilience, and habitat for organisms up the food chain, from insects to otters and eagles. But removals arent straightforward. Federal grants, from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration or the Fish and Wildlife Service, favor projects that benefit federally listed species and many river miles. But even the smallest, simplest projects range in cost from 100,000 to 3 million. To qualify for a grant, be it federal or state, an application has to score well, says Scott Cuppett, who leads the watershed team at the New York State Department of Environmental Conservations Hudson River Estuary Program, which collaborates with nonprofits like Riverkeeper to connect dam owners to technical assistance and money. The application is daunting and can require proof that a removal will conserve or restore migratory fish habitat and reduce flood impacts, sediment and feasibility assessments, plans for accompanying riparian plantings, permits, designs, and letters of support from legislators and neighbors. All this can be overwhelming for dam owners, which is why stakeholders hope additional research will help loosen up some of the requirements. In 2020, Yellen released a study in which he simulated the removal of the 1,702 dams in the lower Hudson watershed, attempting to determine how much sediment might be released if they came down. He found that the vast majority of dams dont really trap much sediment, he says. Thats good news, since it means sediment released into the Hudson will neither permanently worsen water quality nor build up in places that would smother or otherwise harm underwater vegetation. And it shows that you would not need to invest a huge amount of time or effort into a costly sediment management plan, Yellen says. Its a days worth of excavator work to remove some concrete and rock, instead of months of trucking away sand and fill. However, studies on the impacts of sediment quality are still lacking. Sediment trapped behind the dam of a felting mill, which processed wool, might contain mercury, for example, which could cause a states environmental agency to nix removal plans  even if that contaminated sediment is, says Yellen, cleaner than whats already downstream. On a sunny winter afternoon, Feaster, of Riverkeeper, stands in thick mud beside Quassaick Creek in Newburgh, New York. The Strooks Felt Dam, the first of seven municipally owned dams on the lower reaches of this 18-mile tributary, was demolished with state money in 2020. The second dam, called Holden, is slated to come down in late 2025. Feaster is showing a visitor the third, the Walsh Road Dam, whose removal has yet to be funded. This was built into a floodplain, she says, and when it rains the dam overflows to flood a housing complex just around a bend in the creek. Community support for removal of the first three dams was high. But removing the fourth dam, at Muchattoes Lake, might prove trickier. At 23 feet high, its a significant impediment to eel passage. But its impoundment provides the one nearby place townspeople can kayak and fish, which means Feasters team will have its work cut out to convince them of the benefits of removal. There are also ecological reasons to leave dams intact. If pike, an introduced, aggressive sport fish, gets up into the headwaters of the Penobscot River, in Maine, where the removal of two dams in 2012 and 2013 reopened 2,000 miles to 12 sea-run fish species, Fisk says, it would be very happy to snack on all those native wild brook trout. The solution in some of these instances Leave the dam in place and install a fish ladder that sorts out pike and other invasives like rock bass and channel catfish. Quassaick Creek flows freely after the removal of the Strooks Felt Dam, Newburgh, New York. Jessie Deitz On the Quassaick, improvements are evident since the Strooks dam came out. American eel and juvenile blue crabs have already moved in. In fact, fish returns can sometimes be observed within minutes of opening a passageway. Says Schmidt, Weve had dammed rivers where youve been removing the project and when the last piece comes out a fish immediately storms past it. Invasive knotweed lines the creek bank near the Walsh Road dam, but above a nearby culvert, Riverkeeper and New York States Trees for Tribs initiative recently planted 105 young willows and other native trees. Similar plantings will replace the knotweed after the dam comes down, to prevent erosion and to provide shade to cool the creek and falling leaves to oxygenate it. Its really important when were removing barriers to make sure that the whole area is restored, says Catherine Bozek, national fish passage program coordinator for Fish and Wildlife Services Northeast region. Riparian areas often revegetate themselves, she says, but we want to make sure that were managing any invasive species that may come in to ensure better stream health and provide habitat and food for local organisms. As drought shrivels hydro, this African nation pivots to solar. Read more. There is palpable impatience among environmentalists and dam owners to get even more removals going in the Northeast. To that end, collaborators are working to streamline the process. The Fish and Wildlife Service, for example, has formed an interagency fish passage task force with other federal agencies, including NOAA and FEMA, that have their own interests in dam removals. American Rivers is working with regional partners to develop priority lists of dams whose removals would provide the greatest environmental and safety benefits and open up the most river miles to the most important species. Were not going to remove all dams, says Schmidt. But we can be really thoughtful and impactful with the ones that we do choose to remove.

Workers install solar panels on Peace Lutheran Church in Alexandria, Virginia. Andrew Caballero-Reynolds  AFP via Getty Images With billions in investment flowing to GOP districts, Donald Trumps plans to repeal clean energy tax credits face Republican resistance. In an e360 interview, political scientist Leah Stokes, who helped craft U.S. climate law, talks about the new politics of renewable energy. By Elizabeth Kolbert  December 10, 2024 Leah Stokes is an expert on the politics of energy policy. A professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, she helped craft the Biden administrations signature climate law, the Inflation Reduction Act, and, in the summer of 2022, she helped marshal the grassroots support needed to get the bill through Congress. While she was promoting the legislation, Stokes had just given birth to twins, one of whom required medical care Stokes spent countless hours on the phone from the neonatal intensive care unit. For her work on the I.R.A., Time magazine identified Stokes as one of a hundred rising stars from around the world. The citation described her as a thoughtful leader, researcher, expert communicator, and organizer all rolled into one dynamic  and very fun  person. With Donald Trump set to reoccupy the White House and Republicans in charge of both houses of Congress, key provisions of the I.R.A. appear to be endangered. In September, Trump said that, if elected, he would rescind all unspent funds under the misnamed I.R.A. His transition team is said to be particularly keen on repealing the bills tax credit for purchasing electric vehicles. But there is expected to be pushback from companies and constituencies that are benefitting from the I.R.A., including from GOP lawmakers whose districts would be affected the most. E360 contributor Elizabeth Kolbert spoke to Stokes about the prospects for the I.R.A., the politics of clean energy, and the possibility of future action on climate change. Leah Stokes. Lucy Lu Elizabeth Kolbert The Inflation Reduction Act was passed entirely with Democratic votes. But a lot of the money has gone to red districts for new battery plants and EV plants, projects that should bring jobs and should have won political support. It seems that Democrats really didnt get any credit for that. It also doesnt seem to have created a new constituency for clean energy, which was, I would think, the political hope. Leah Stokes Yeah, the law is based on the theory of industrial policy  which is that if you build stuff in the United States, you create jobs in all corners of the country and that will keep the law in place. We dont know the answer to that story yet. Thats what were going to find out in the next two years. Subscribe to the E360 Newsletter for weekly updates delivered to your inbox. Sign Up. I believe that corporate lobbying is going to keep a lot of the law in place. I really believe that. The things that will be on the table are largely clean energy tax credits, because the grants will be mostly out the door by the time the Biden administration wraps up at the beginning of January. These tax credits are benefiting companies, and youre already seeing the reporting that for even the most vulnerable tax credits, which I would assume are the EV tax credits, theres a constituency out there trying to defend those. Companies have made investments that take years to really come to fruition, and they cant really turn around on a dime. And when you think about all the manufacturing investments that are in these Republican districts, its not just the manufacturing jobs that matter. You start to realize that all those investments in making stuff in America, they want to sell that stuff in America too. And in order to sell that stuff in America, they need the other tax credits for deployment. So thats where you start to have the tech-neutral tax credit for clean power, the home energy efficiency tax credit, the home solar tax credit, the EV tax credit and so on. I just think that this is going to be a much stickier policy than many people would suspect. I wrote a history of the production tax credit aimed at boosting wind energy, which was first passed in 1992 under George H. W. Bush, and the investment tax credit aimed at boosting solar energy, which was first passed in 2005 under George W. Bush. And those policies, man, people kept trying to kill them. They kept trying to not extend them, and they just stick around. Maybe they lapse for three months here, six months there, and then they come back. Thats decades ago now, and the solar and wind industries are not start-ups anymore. They are massive employers in the United States. Kolbert What are the things in the I.R.A. that havent turned out to work particularly well? Stokes I feel that there was a real perfectionism in the Biden administration to make sure that every dollar was spent in the absolute perfect way. That looked pretty silly the day after the November election when all this money was stuck in government coffers because they were really trying to make sure it was all spent perfectly. Kolbert But most of the actual grant money will already be out the door by the time we get to January? Stokes Certainly most. It wont be all. There will be some pretty painful losses. Im particularly concerned about Community Change Grants aimed at helping disadvantaged communities cut pollution and prepare for climate change. You can get up to 20 million for things like a community solar project. Its just a really hard thing to get all that money out the door. Kolbert It seems like environmental justice is really on the chopping block. Stokes All the work that was done across the agencies to integrate environmental justice into, for example, how grants are dispersed to make sure the money and benefits are flowing to disadvantaged communities  all that stuff I think is pretty at risk. Kolbert And now were going to presumably withdraw again from the Paris Agreement. Stokes Yeah, I think it will be demoralizing for people, but the fact is that the United States will still be making progress. We saw this in 2016 when a lot of these cities and states and counties said, Hey, were still in. So I think theres actually still going to be a lot of progress. The interesting thing about the clean energy transition is that it has a lot to do with companies investing in and making money from the transition. I think that that is going to be the engine that keeps progress moving forward in the absence of federal leadership. Kolbert But youve written about how on the state level, companies that dont want to make progress are really good at undermining state legislation. Im wondering why you think thats not going to happen again. Stokes Well, the theory that I put forward in my book Short Circuiting Policy is that the opponents were stronger than the advocates. I am betting that the advocates are starting to be stronger than the opponents, and thats going to change the dynamics. The reason why I think that is even just Elon Musk  a person who made his fortune off electric vehicles and solar and batteries  having such a prominent role, whether you love it or hate it, in this administration. Trump 2.0 This time the stakes for climate are even higher. Read more. Last time we had Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson become the secretary of state. Thats the difference. This time you have someone like Elon. He has a different interest. Now, what we might see is almost like a crony capitalism where the interest of a specific company, as opposed to the whole industry, might prevail, when it comes to, for example, the EV tax credit. Maybe they repeal it because its not really in Teslas interest, which gives a bit of a competitive advantage to them that the other companies arent getting, because Tesla is so much further along. How exactly that plays out is to be determined. Kolbert A lot of people have said, Look, theres a lot of energy and momentum behind this transition, and Trump can slow it, but he cant stop it. But speed is the issue here. How much damage can Trump do? Stokes Well, were going to find out. I think hes going to have two years. I think theres going to be a big swing in the other direction in the 2026 midterm elections. Then they start to have less of an opportunity to do legislative work. I agree with you on speed, of course. In order to really take on this transition, we cant actually have this much whiplash in the policy space. If there is some depolarization that starts to play out in this moment, that might be worth a lot in terms of the transition. You think about somebody like Republican Senator John Curtis of Utah. Senator Curtis has a fully electrified home. Now hes in the Senate and hes saying things like, Look, were not going to throw the whole I.R.A out. Were going to tweak it. Maybe were going back towards a period where we at least have some constructive engagement from Republicans because of the jobs in their district, because of prominent people like Elon Musk having senior leadership positions. When we talk of depolarizing climate change, I think in our minds we have some folk theory that well all get along and believe in science and go off into the future together. Its probably not going to be like that. Its probably going to be more like Elon Musk becoming a shadow president and caring about solar and batteries and pissing off a lot of left-wing people like me who maybe dont agree with all of his politics on everything, but the fact is that he has massive investments in clean energy and electrification. That might not be what we want the transition to look like, if were really lefty progressives, but it might be what the transition is going to look like. And that world is better than complete retrenchment and repeal when it comes to climate policy. Im not saying its better when it comes to immigration policy or womens rights or 1,000 other things  our democracy. Theres a lot of reasons why people have a right to feel really scared and upset, but when it comes to the climate, Im less depressed than other people. Kolbert Do you see a depolarized future here? Stokes The Republican Party has long been married to all kinds of corporate interests. Its just been married to the particular interest of the fossil fuel industry for a couple of decades. Wouldnt it be great if there was somebody to rival the fossil fuel industry, in terms of their relationship with the Republican Party? A Hyundai EV plant being built in Ellabell, Georgia, in August 2023. The plant is supported by tax credits from the I.R.A. Stephen B. Morton  Bloomberg via Getty Images Kolbert You have pointed out the Inflation Reduction Act isnt going to get us all the way to our Paris Agreement goals anyway. Were going to need something else of a similar magnitude. And that is not happening in the next four years. Do you see that over some distant horizon or when you peer into the future? Stokes Yeah, I think in some ways, 2029 is a better opportunity to pass climate policy than 2025 was ever going to be. The Democratic Party had this idea that they had already dealt with climate change, which was not true, unfortunately. There were so many other topics to talk about in this election. I think in 2029 there will be more of an appetite to do climate policy. The challenge is we have so little time left on the clock that we really have to be pushing climate laws again and again, but that isnt really how the legislative system works or how the activist community works. Its really hard to do everything we all just did to get the I.R.A. passed, and then we need to do it again? Thats pretty hard. Kolbert I hear your twins in the background. What is the message you want them to hear? Theyre the generation that could be around in 2100. Whats causing the recent spike in global temperatures? Read more. Stokes A lot of people who worked on the I.R.A. made this calculus Hey, this is the most important thing I can do to protect my kids. I feel like more and more, if you look at the young Republicans, they believe in climate change. They know this stuff is coming. Maybe thats what depolarization ends up looking like. Which would be good, because the status quo is not exactly great. This interview was edited for length and clarity.

Courtesy of Martin Wikelski Scientists studying migrations, endangered species, and global change are placing tracking devices on thousands of animals that will be monitored by a satellite-based system set to launch next year. If successful, the project could help illuminate the planets nonhuman worlds. By Hillary Rosner  July 30, 2024 Field biologists tend to be a patient lot, often resigned to long days and weeks in the field and committed to experiments that take years to yield results. But even among that dogged crowd, Martin Wikelski stands out. Back in 2001, sitting on a porch one evening in Panama, the German ornithologist had the germ of an idea for an internet of animals, a global system of sensor-wearing wildlife that would reveal the planets elusive, nonhuman worlds. He figured he could get it up and running by 2005. Nearly 20 years later, Wikelski may have finally succeeded  after surmounting roadblocks that range from bureaucratic mishaps to technical glitches to a geopolitical crisis. His space-based system, known as ICARUS International Cooperation for Animal Research Using Space, is now scheduled to launch, in its latest, satellite-based incarnation, on a private rocket sometime in 2025. The underlying idea of the internet of animals is to tune into the planets hidden phenomena  the flight paths followed by sharp-shinned hawks, the precise fates befalling Arctic terns that die young, the exact landscape requirements of critically endangered saiga antelope  by attaching tiny, solar-powered tracking devices, some weighing less than a paperclip, to all kinds of organisms and even some inanimate objects glaciers, ocean plastic debris. The inexpensive, globe-spanning system of animal tagging is meant to help scientists understand the precise drivers of global change, and much more, by tracking thousands of tagged animals from space and tying their experiences to the broader impacts facing whole populations or even species. Wikelski, the director of the Department of Migration at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior, in Germany, said the prospect of having that data, and of making people aware of the incredible beauty and richness of whats happening out there, has made the effort worthwhile, even urgent. Its also true, as he wrote in his recent book The Internet of Animals Discovering the Collective Intelligence of Life on Earth, that he had no clue how many pitfalls there would be how many times when we desperately wanted to give up, because the whole process had become so exquisitely frustrating that we just couldnt stand it anymore. Subscribe to the E360 Newsletter for weekly updates delivered to your inbox. Sign Up. In 2018, after years of working with designers, engineers, and government officials from multiple countries and continents, Wikelskis team saw its ICARUS receiver launch aboard a Soyuz rocket from Kazakhstan to the International Space Station, where Russian cosmonauts attached it to their side of the orbiting lab. We danced, cried, and hugged one another, Wikelski wrote of the launch. All the stress of nearly 20 years fell away. The internet of animals went live in March 2020, but before the year was out, mechanical issues on the Russian ISS module took the system down. Nearly a year passed before it was up and running again. By the spring of 2021, the system was finally humming along, receiving data from roughly 3,500 tagged animals around the world. But then, in the winter of 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, and the West cut ties with Russia. ICARUSs transmission of data abruptly halted. Russian cosmonauts install the ICARUS receiver on the outside of the International Space Station, August 2018. Alexander Gerst  ESA After the ISS failure, Wikelskis team set out to redesign the system to use satellite-based receivers, which had always been its long-term aim. In 2022, plans seemed almost set for an ICARUS receiver to orbit on the next GRACE Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellite, a joint venture between NASA and the German space agency, scheduled to launch in 2028. But last-minute political haggling siphoned more than a third of the projects German funding, leaving no money to include ICARUS. We were totally devastated, Wikelski recalled. He gave his project three months to find a solution or finally give up. Thats when we scaled down and said, we need a CubeSat. And so beginning sometime next year, the project plans to launch ICARUS receivers on five relatively low-cost CubeSats  miniature satellites roughly the size of a Rubiks cube and weighing only a couple of pounds  using private launch companies. Funded by the Max Planck Society, the system will cost roughly 1.57 million to launch and have annual operating expenses of around 160,000. The geopolitical aspect of this is pretty huge, said Michael Wunder, a quantitative ecologist at the University of Colorado Denver who used the ISS tags to study the migration patterns of mountain plovers before the war in Ukraine cut off the research. Instead of involving government space agencies, the projects new iteration keeps the scientists in control. The new system allows for greater global coverage  the ISS receiver couldnt communicate with tags at the planets highest latitudes  and Wikelskis team has used the intervening years to shrink the tags by several grams and design new ways for animals to wear them, vastly expanding the number of species scientists can study. The team is currently upgrading 4,000 older tags to work with the new system. The tags provide hourly accounts of the animals energy expenditure measure environmental factors like air pressure, altitude, temperature, and humidity and even use AI to help interpret the animals behavior. The trove of data will open a lot of doors for researchers, said Ashley Lohr, who coordinates North American projects for ICARUS through the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences. How stressed was the animal? What were the environmental conditions when the animal was at this place at this time? Wunders lab group tagged 17 mountain plovers in Colorado in 2021. Native to the plains of the north-central United Staes, the species has declined by 80 percent in the past six decades. But the birds are hard to study because of their habitat and behavior. Theyre singing and vociferous but not in your face, Wunder said, and in breeding season they like their space, living in densities of only about three birds per square kilometer. The plovers often occupy private ranchlands, which makes them hard to find without trespassing. And they breed in late March and April, while bird surveys, timed to count migratory songbirds, happen in May. Biologist Martin Wikelski tags a scarlet macaw with an ICARUS transmitter. Courtesy of Martin Wikelski Wunder has long sought to understand whether mountain plovers follow distinct, structured migration patterns or whether birds from different areas mix together in winter flocks. He also wants to learn what drives the birds to migrate. Are they moving away from something or toward something else? he asks. He also hopes to determine exactly where the birds are running into trouble. Before the ISS receiver went dark in 2022, the ICARUS tags revealed that the plovers didnt follow fixed migration routes and that birds from around the country were mingling in the winter. When several transmitting birds died, Wunder was able to dispatch researchers to their locations and discover the cause of death  predation. The birds started returning to Colorado in February, and Wunder was eager to see which ones would come back  but then the war in Ukraine began. We were cut off, there was no more information, he said. Ellen Aikens, a biologist at the University of Wyoming who did her postdoctoral research on animal migration at the Max Planck Institute, believes that ICARUS could serve as a democratizing force in ecology and biology. Its a way to level the playing field, she says, so that folks that have a smaller budget or are working on species that are a bit more obscure and theres not as much funding behind can start to get the same kind of information, baseline info, about where those animals are going. In her lab, Aikens is studying golden eagles using a tag made by the German company e-obs. Its the gold standard of biologging in bird research, if you can afford it and your bird is big enough to carry the transformer  like geese, storks, and eagles. A single e-obs tag costs more than 1,500 and works over a cellular network, meaning researchers must also pay the cost of data transmission for as long as the animal lives. If you want to get a good sample size that will allow you to publish your research, that adds up really quickly, Aikens said. ICARUS tags are cheaper by an order of magnitude. The race to save glacial ice records before they melt away. Read more. Aikens believes that ICARUS will help transform the way scientists study animals. Our nonhuman neighbors can take a pulse of the planet and be detectors of change and help us understand the health of the environment, she said. As animals move these vast distances, they can collect detailed environmental information that can better inform climate models and collect information in places that are difficult to monitor, whether high in the sky, deep in the ocean, or under a thick layer of ice. ICARUS tags are solar-powered, whereas some existing tagging systems run on batteries, which can die  ending the research on that individual or requiring recapture to change them out. Other tagging systems rely on animals passing by a signal tower. It works for certain animals, like birds and bats, but not for others. Because ICARUS is satellite-powered, you dont have to wait for your animal to go back on the grid and pass by a tower, said Lohr. Instead, each time a satellite passes over an area, data from nearby tagged animals will be uploaded to Movebank, an open-access database. Ultimately, researchers hope that ICARUS data can help us pinpoint effective conservation strategies, Aikens said. It can help us identify pinch points on the landscape. While this is already happening for some species, including North American ungulates like elk and pronghorn antelope, whose migrations researchers have tracked for years, for most of the planets species we lack this data and this wide coverage of information, which makes these fine-scale interventions a lot harder to achieve. Thats a place that ICARUS can help fill in a lot of gaps. And if the internet of animals can zero in on specific issues  for instance, a bird species dying out because a particular insect it eats is being killed by a particular chemical being sprayed in an area  Wikelski believes such information could drive people to act. People are willing to do something about it if they know that what they do is really helpful, he said. For now, Wikelski continues to practice patience. When I spoke to him in early July, he was dealing with the latest hurdle satellite launch delays, including one caused by a payload issue and another caused by an ill-timed summer holiday that delayed authorization of the 30,000 payment needed to secure a launch reservation. Our project is now too small to really be on everybodys horizon, he said. Before, it was too large. Nevertheless, Wikelski was hopeful. His team was studying and perfecting the lowest-stress methods of tagging animals and even testing automatic tagging systems, like one for deer involving a salt lick and a tiny elastic band. He remained confident of ICARUSs potential. Grim dilemma Should we kill one owl species to save another? Read more. One really important aspect we think is transformative in biology is the scaling up of tagging, he said. So you dont have one animal but 50 or 100, or you do it across a continent. Over the next two years he plans to tag 9,000 animals in Europe, including blackbirds, storm thrushes, swifts, and sparrows in a study already underway. Roughly 7,000 of those 9,000 would die in the first year, he said, based on general patterns. That means we are finally understanding where they disappear. Where are the death traps? These tags are so smart, they can tell us if a female is nesting and if the clutch disappears. So we can not only get information on where the adults are living and dying, but have the adults been successful in hatching or clutching? Is there a massive problem in a certain area? Then we can link individuals to populations and understand the drivers of change.

An executive order issued in the early days of the Trump administration hit pause on at least 4 billion set aside to protect the flow of the Colorado River. The funds from the Inflation Reduction Act were offered to protect the flow of the water supply for about 40 million people and a massive agricultural economy. With the money on hold, Colorado River users are worried about the future of the dwindling water supply. The river is shrinking due to climate change. The nations two largest reservoirs, Lake Mead and Lake Powell, created by dams on the Colorado River, have reached record low levels in recent years amid a megadrought spanning more than two decades. If water levels fall much lower, they could lose the ability to generate hydropower within the massive dams that hold them back, or even lose the ability to pass water downstream. The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, allowed Biden to designate 4 billion for Colorado River programs, funding farmers, cities, and Native American tribes to conserve Colorado River water by leaving it in those reservoirs. T... Read more Alex Hager, KUNC Drought The Colorado River District plans to buy the water rights that flow through Colorados Shoshone hydropower plant.

His book about climate migration, The Great Displacement, is published by Simon  Schuster. Less than a month before the Eaton Fire engulfed Altadena, longtime residents thought theyd finally resolved a bruising debate over the California suburbs future. For months theyd debated a Los Angeles County government plan poised to dramatically alter the character of the quiet community of just over 40,000 people, which sits at the edge of the Angeles National Forest. The plan limited construction in Altadenas fire-prone foothills and simultaneously increased buildable density in its commercial corridors, allowing for hundreds of new housing units in the flat downtown area. It promised to both relieve the regions critical housing shortage and also reduce wildfire risk accelerated by climate change. In prickly public meetings and press statements, prominent residents staked out opposing positions. One side was represented by Michael Bicay, a retired NASA scientist who has for decades opposed construction in the Altadena hills on ecological grounds.

Δ A nonprofit, independent media organization dedicated to telling stories of climate solutions and a just future. Δ While Mikaela Balkind was working on her degree at the University of Washington in 2018, she was looking for a way to bridge her two interests in natural resource management and climate science. So when she came across a friends Instagram post about a women in wildland firefighting bootcamp, she thought to herself, Wow, this is perfect. Over two weekends in Vale, Oregon, she learned skills like how to dig a fire line and use different tools and equipment during a fire deployment, all part of training she would need for a red card, the main certification a wildland firefighter needs to work. But the bootcamp offered something else, too  a less intimidating entry point into the male-dominated field where approximately 13 percent of firefighters are women. Its just sometimes easier to take that first step when you feel like youre supported by your peers, she said. I think it just gave me a little bit of reassurance. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Heres How Part of what made the training special for Balkind were the nightly fireside chats with women who made firefighting their career, which gave her the confidence to apply for jobs in the field. After the bootcamp she began working on seasonal firefighting crews and is now pursuing a masters in Montana studying wildland fire science. I can largely attribute the last five or six years of my life to going to one of those bootcamps and opening myself up to this field that I become obsessed with and passionate about, she said. The same training that changed the trajectory of Balkinds life has now been canceled as part of a government-wide effort to rid agencies of programs that focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion under the Trump administration. Descriptions of the trainings on the U.S. Forest Service website have been taken down. And though announcements about the bootcamps are still up on the websites for the Bureau of Land Management and the National Park Service, they now have this language at the top Any previously issued diversity, equity, inclusion, or gender-related guidance on this webpage should be considered rescinded. And, the U.S. Forest Service Women in Wildland Fire Advisory Council, which was launched last year to help women in the field convene and find policy solutions for things like parental leave and child care, no longer has support from the Forest Service, said Riva Duncan, vice president of the advocacy group Grassroots Wildland Fire. Inside the federal government, all of that is gone, Duncan said. Its all been scrapped. Grist thanks its sponsors. Become one. To support our nonprofit environmental journalism, please consider disabling your ad-blocker to allow ads on Grist. Heres How The effort to dismantle any DEI work is hard to understand for Duncan, who fought wildland fires for 32 years. Its just unfathomable why anybody would think diversity, inclusion, and equity are bad things, she said. Its going to probably set things back and hurt the recruitment and retention of women into this profession. Agency spokesperson Wade Muehlhof wrote in an email response that while the training is currently paused, there are opportunities for both men and women to complete required wildland firefighter training. Muehlhof noted that these bootcamps are not a prerequisite for becoming a wildland firefighter. However, theyve been a way to try and level the playing field for women who historically have faced obstacles in the industry, said Abigail Varney, a wildland fire fellow at the Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability, who published a report last year detailing how the wildland fire service could make the workforce more diverse. Programs like the bootcamp or other things designed for women or other underrepresented groups in fire are not because of an issue of competence or a need for additional training, it is because we are often given fewer opportunities to practice skills and build our competence, she said. The justification provided to end these diversity-in-the-workforce programs is usually that they arent based on merit and instead give an unfair advantage to certain groups, Varney said. But in reality, these efforts are actually attempting to correct what has started out and continues to not be a fair playing field. What actually prevents the system to be truly based on merit is discrimination, its harassment, its bias, its unequal protection. Varney, who has also worked as a wildland firefighter, said bringing more representation isnt just the right thing to do but it creates a better wildland firefighting workforce at a time when the climate crisis is leading to more destructive fire seasons. We really cant afford to not be utilizing the entirety of the workforce thats interested and excited about being a part of the solution, she said. We need innovative approaches, and diverse perspectives are really a crucial part of that. A more representative workforce also makes it easier to communicate and earn trust from communities that are caught up in fires, Varney said. Having diverse people within agencies operating on the fire line, acting as agency administrators, acting as liaisons with the community, being able to accurately reflect their concerns, their needs, their desires, is essential in order to build a better relationship with fire and to more effectively do our job, she said. And, in the field, women still have to meet the same physical standards that men do, including passing the infamous pack test, which requires firefighters to carry 45 pounds for three miles in less than 45 minutes. But what the training offers is something men already have  a built-in network and camaraderie. They provide a space to talk about things like how to handle a period when deployed for weeks at a time, or something as simple as changing your sports bra in the morning when were all cowboy camping out in the field, and you dont have that privacy, Balkind said. They also form a sense of community for participants to fall back on when more serious issues like assault or discrimination come up out in the field. Its actually part of the reason why last year, Balkind decided to convene her own bootcamp. She had previously experienced sexual harassment while working on a seasonal crew where she was the only woman. I didnt have another female to go to, to talk to about this. I had to talk to my head supervisor, and it was like, this is not the support that I need, she said. In the years after, she noticed that when she was on crews that had more women, the dynamics were different, and it reminded her of the importance of her bootcamp in Oregon. So she set to work to organize a bootcamp in Montana. Last fall, 18 women convened from all over the country for the four-day training held by the universitys FireCenter. Balkind said it went so well that the Forest Service had actually reached out about assisting with the bootcamps in the future. Now, that proposition feels unlikely.

Gran Canaria and Tenerife worst affected, while eastern Australia prepares for first tropical cyclone for 50 years On Monday, a storm brought heavy rainfall to the Canary Islands, especially affecting Gran Canaria and Tenerife. Telde, in eastern Gran Canaria received more than 30mm of rain, nearly three times the March average. Flash floods submerged homes, turned streets into rivers, and swept cars out to sea. Airports and popular beaches shut down ahead of the downpour, affecting more than 850,000 residents. The islands mountainous topography, tropical climate and urbanisation worsened the floods by aiding thunderstorm formation and runoff.Snow accumulated on Mount Teide in Tenerife, creating a rare but disruptive scene for emergency services and local infrastructure. The storm was driven by a weather system known locally as depresión aislada en niveles altos Dana, which translates as an isolated depression at high levels. This occurs when cold air at high altitudes mixes with warm, moist air below, creating unstable conditions and significant rainfall. Mainland Spain is expected to receive heavy rain in the coming days as the Dana system moves north-eastwards across the Iberian peninsula. Meanwhile, Cyclone Alfred, forming in the Coral Sea off eastern Australia, is set to make landfall early Saturday between the Sunshine Coast and Gold Coast, affecting Brisbane, Queensland and New South Wales. Classified on Friday morning as a category 2 storm with gusts of up to 80mph, it is expected to bring 800mm of rainfall, flooding, and storm surges, affecting more than 4 million people. Schools and airports have closed in preparation. Alfred is set to be the first tropical cyclone to hit the east coast in 50 years, with its rare southward path driven by ocean temperatures almost 1C warmer than normal, alongside its recent interaction with a mid-latitude trough causing it to make a sharp U-turn towards Australias eastern coast. Powerful storms and tornadoes have battered the southern US this week, bringing heavy rain, flooding, 70mph winds, lightning-sparked wildfires and dust storms. Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma have been hit hardest, with about 22 tornadoes recorded by 6 March, including one that caused a building to collapse. Strong winds left 500,000 people without power, and the storms have resulted in three deaths and six injuries. The severe weather has also disrupted the popular Mardi Gras festival.

Floods, whale strandings and coral bleaching all more likely, say researchers, as 10 of ocean hits record high temperatures in 2023-24 The worlds oceans experienced three-and-a-half times as many marine heatwave days last year and in 2023 compared with any other year on record, a study has found. The sustained spike in ocean temperatures cost lives and caused billions of dollars in storm damage, increased whale and dolphin stranding risks, harmed commercial fishing and sparked a global coral bleaching, according to the paper published on Friday in Nature Climate Change. Like heatwaves on land, a marine heatwave is defined as a period of higher than normal temperature over a longer than usual time. The most recent of these were brought about by human-induced climate change and amplified by El Niño conditions, the reports authors said, with nearly 10 of the ocean hitting record high temperatures in 2023-24. The more regularly our marine ecosystems are being hit by marine heatwaves, the harder it is for them to recover from each event, said lead author Kathryn Smith from the UKs Marine Biological Association. Higher ocean temperatures supercharge evaporation, the study said, fuelling storms such as Cyclone Gabrielle which hit New Zealand in February 2023, killing 11 people and costing an estimated NZ14.5bn about 6.5bn. One of the most surprising findings in the study, said Smith, was how much marine heatwaves accentuated storms on land and the number of people that were hit by that  hurt, lost possessions, suffered a monetary impact or lost their lives. More worryingly, she said There is going to be a huge amount more about the impacts of marine heatwaves that we dont know about yet because of the time it takes to publish in scientific literature. The effect on species was often devastating. Whales and dolphins venture closer to shore when the water is warm because they follow their prey, so this increased their chances of stranding, said Smith. For Mediterranean fan mussels, which have been dying in their millions since 2016, marine heatwaves may be the final nail in the coffin because the warming waters bring increased risk of diseases, the study said. Although human intervention saved some marine life from the recent heatwaves, the study found damage reduction was mostly lacking, possibly due to limited resources, disconnects between organisations and poor communication. When there was time to prepare, successful mitigation actions included moving corals and conches in Florida to deeper, cooler water and keeping endangered Tasmanian red handfish in aquariums until they could be returned to the wild. For corals, the study said initiatives to create new colonies using assisted sexual reproduction that increases genetic diversity showed potential, with increased resilience to bleaching observed in trial populations of reef-building corals across the Caribbean and Mexico. Increased ocean temperatures can sometimes bring small wins, the study noted. In Peru, for example, while the anchovy catch was badly affected by the fish moving outside their normal range  a shift that led to commercial fishery closures and estimated losses of 1.4bn 1.1bn  squid landings increased. Better forecasting, the study found, is critical to reducing damage from severe marine heatwaves, because it provides greater confidence for those making damage limitation decisions. Valeria Pizarro, a scientist at Americas Perry Institute for Marine Science, who was not part of the study, said watching corals bleach in the blink of my eyes made her feel very sad and frustrated. In most cases, she said, the paper showed effective responses to marine heatwaves were lacking because we werent prepared, we didnt have the money or the manpower to do much in such a short period of time. More broadly, said Smith, the direct link between the climate crisis and ocean temperatures means that until we see a switch from fossil fuels to renewable energy, marine heatwaves, and the damage they do, will continue to increase.
