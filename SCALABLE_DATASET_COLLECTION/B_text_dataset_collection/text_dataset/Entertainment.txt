The Substance actress also told Madison she cant wait to see what you do next. Amy SussmanGetty Demi Moore is taking a very classy moment to reflect on the monumental awards season she just had. Thanks to key precursor wins at the Golden Globes and SAG Awards  and endlessly charming and passionate speeches at said ceremonies  many awards prognosticators penciled in Moore to win the Oscar for Best Actress for her role in The Substance at Sunday nights Academy Awards. When the envelope was read on stage by last years winner, Emma Stone, however, it was Anora star Mikey Madison who reigned victorious. In an Instagram post on Monday, Moore made it clear she was taking it all in stride. As this awards season comes to a close, Im so overwhelmed with gratitude for this journey, she wrote, alongside a video reel of her pre- and post-Oscars glam routines. Its been the ride of a lifetime and were just getting started! So grateful for my team, my fellow nominees, and everyone who has made this experience so full of joy and light. She then thanked the cast, crew, and fans of The Substance, giving special shoutouts to costar Margaret Qualley and the films writer and director, Coralie Fargeat, before addressing Madison directly. Its been such an honor to work alongside you, learn from you, and celebrate this film with you, she wrote, adding, And a huge congratulations to MikeyMadison  cant wait to see what you do next. Moore ended her note with a heart emoji. She may not have won the Oscar, but the 62-year-old star did still walk away with a surprising prize on Sunday night  two giant plates of tasty-looking French fries, as peeped in the reel and on her daughter Tallulah Willis Instagram, below. Moore also attended the 2025 Vanity Fair Oscar party with Tallulah and her other daughters, Scout and Rumer. The Instagram post serves as a bookend to an awards season full of Moore having plenty of moving things to say. When she won at the Golden Globes  an honor she said marked the first time Ive ever won anything as an actor  she shared a bit about what The Substance taught her. Ill just leave you with one thing that I think this movie is imparting, she said. In those moments when we dont think were smart enough or pretty enough or skinny enough or successful enough  or basically, just not enough  I had a woman say to me, Just know, you will never be enough. But you can know the value of your worth if you just put down the measuring stick. Want more movie news?

For the gift of doing something I love and being reminded that I do belong, thank you so much.

By Peter White Executive Editor, Television A day after her latest album, Mayhem, was released, Lady Gaga reminded Saturday Night Live that she can sing. I know you might be thinking Im here to promote my album, Mayhem, but Im actually here to remind you Im an amazing actor, she said during her monologue. But, it turned out, Gaga was in full voice during the sketches. After riding across New York on an electric suitcase in the opening sketch alongside Marcello Hernandez, Gaga teamed up with Bowen Yang for a parody duet. Dressed in a red dress, the pair mocked up their own version of Eric Claptons Wonderful Tonight. Related Stories Late Night TV SNL Promo Lady Gaga Draws Cast Into Her Rather Humiliating Musical Process News Bill Murray Defends John Belushi After Bob Woodwards Completely Inaccurate Biography Its later that evening and were wasted in times square, sings Yang. So, I eat a full Big Mac and I shave off my body hair, sings Gaga. And then she bites me on both my nipples left and right, and I say bitch you look wonderful tonight. Watch on Deadline Next up, a Midnight Matinee, one of the digital shorts written by Dan Bulla, seemingly a Stuart Little-style parody where Gaga once again sings, this time at the piano. Remember, this is the same woman who turned up to the SNL50 Homecoming Concert to sing Dick in a Box with Andy Samberg. Elsewhere, she reminded the audience she can also dance with a roaring 20s themed routine in a funeral home, obviously. Bowen Yang is a big fan of the popstar. At the Oscars, he told Entertainment Tonight that he would be jetting straight back to New York. I want to be there the entire time. I cannot miss a moment of the Lady Gaga week at SNL, he said. As such it made sense for Yang, wearing a Mayhem t-shirt, to introduce Gaga singing Abracadabra, the second single from her new album that harks back to her early dance pop numbers and theatrical vibes. The show marks the second time that the Poker Face star has pulled double duty she also performed and hosted in November 2013. She has also performed as the musical guest three other times in October 2009, May 2011 and October 2016. Gagas second performance saw her perform Killah, the David Bowie-inspired sixth track from Mayhem. She closed the show out with another duet with Yang. As their friends  played by Ego Nwodim, Andrew Dismukes, Bowen Yang, Sarah Sherman and Ashley Padilla  the pair sang to encourage them to stop saying the word Slay among other millennial catchphrases. No more slay, we stole words from other people and were giving them back today, they sang. Abracadabra  ladygaga pic.twitter.comamGse8hBX6 Get our Breaking News Alerts and Keep your inbox happy.

By Anthony DAlessandro Editorial DirectorBox Office Editor Cannes weighs the reception to its world premieres in standing ovations however, at SXSW, theyre measured by screams. Anecdotally, in a battle of It girls in Austin, it could be argued that Ms. Jenna Ortega received more cheers tonight following the world premiere of her A24 genre comedy Death of Unicorn than Blake Lively did at her opening night premiere of Amazon MGM Studios Another Simple Plan, but that would be like assessing the distance of Aaron Judge homeruns. Clad in a plaid suit and maroon satin shirt and tie, the Wednesday star kept it glib among the ensemble of Paul Rudd, Will Poulter, Richard E. Grant, Téa Leoni, Anthony Carrigan, Steve Park and Sunita Mani onstage at the Paramount. Asked by the moderator how Rudd and Ortega bonded on set as father and daughter, the actress answered, Fortunately, we got on, we had a couple of conversations, we started shooting a day or two after we met. Rudd answered hysterically, Fortunately, we had the experience. Jenna is a daughter in real life, and Im actually a dad! We hit it off right away, when youre lucky enough to act with Jenna Ortega, your job is easy because shes incredible! The movie follows a father and daughter, Elliot and Ridley, who are on the formers business trip. Hes trying to sign a mega-wealthy pharmaceutical CEO and his family as clients. But on the way to the familys estate, Elliot hits a unicorn with the car. Ridley has a spiritual connection with the dying baby beast. The whole incident sets off the unicorns mother and father to look for it, laying destruction to anybody in its path. The pic repped the feature directorial debut of Alex Scharfman and its executive produced by A24 edgy and absurdist heavyweight Ari Aster. Poulter said, We really had the most fun in the world, giving kudos to Scharfman for setting a playful environment on set. This tipped Grant to ultimately deadpan just how much the ensemble bonded during shooting Being somebody who grew up in the 70s because Im the oldest person in this room, and there are no moral police in Hungary, the fact that we had group sex as a cast on a daily basis Grant earlier had another pun about working on the unicorn horror film I love getting horned. Rudd responded, When in Budapest Pocket full of sunshine right there! chimed in Carrigan at which point Ortega dropped to her knees laughing. Carrigan plays the dutiful, largely silent family servant in the movie. Ortega added to great laughs from the crowd, To credit Anthonys silent acting, we didnt realize until we were two thirds in the film, that he had a Scottish accent. Poulter said, Anthony was so funny in this movie, there were scenes that I would take my contact lenses out so I wouldnt see him. I was like, were not going to get the day.

By Glenn Garner Associate Editor Although writer-director Alex Scharfman makes a big swing with his A24 horror comedy debut, Death of a Unicorn struggles to live up to its bold premise. The movie stars Paul Rudd and Jenna Ortega as Elliot and Ridley Kinter, an estranged father and daughter who put on a united front to get his family-oriented boss to sign a major deal at his isolated Canadian mansion, located on a mysterious nature preserve. But when they hit a unicorn on the drive in, the pair and their wealthy hosts soon become hunted by a pack of mythological beasts. As the films moral compass, Elliot urges the group to leave the creature be, but when the discovery leads to unprecedented miracle cures, the pharma-rich Leopolds instantly see dollar signs. But for a movie with a nearly two-hour runtime and a bonkers title with the plot to match, the action kicks off awfully late into the movie. Meanwhile, the laughs and gore are few and far between, and the satirical element ultimately takes a backseat to the fatherdaughter dynamic, which is heartfelt enough on its own though we came for the unicorn bloodbath. Watch on Deadline With supporting performances from incomparable talents like Téa Leoni, Richard E. Grant, Will Poulter, Sunita Mani and Anthony Carrigan, the caliber of comedy feels underutilized. And while the film touches on some serious issues through a humorous lens  like addiction, price-gouging and science deniers  the message felt uneven, hidden beneath a comedy-horror that struggles to find its footing, despite its star-studded roster. Its hard not to find relevance in a movie filled with generational strife about the world were leaving to our children, where the rich get richer and the poor keep working their asses off for a shot at a comfortable living. But watching rich people become the brutal victims of their own greed is feeling less and less like horror and more like torture porn for the 99 in the age of Luigi Mangione.

By Pete Hammond Awards ColumnistChief Film Critic It is probably no accident that among Matthew Shears acting credits are no less than four movies directed by New York filmmaker extraordinaire Noah Baumbach, or that one of his most recent is another angst-ridden Jewish comedy, Between The Temples. Clearly he has spent his downtime on those sets soaking up the atmosphere and the comedic beats in preparation for his writingdirecting debut, Fantasy Life premiering at the SXSW Festival today in the Narrative Feature competition. Assembling a dream cast of actors who know how to deliver this kind of New York Jewish-centric character-driven comedy that Woody Allen trademarked and others like Baumbach have also travelled in so successfully, Shear actually seems to me to be more of a modern-day Richard Benjamin who also turned into a fine filmmaker in his own right. That seems to be the trajectory here except Shear is clearly cribbing from his own life and experience with depression, anxiety and self-admitted mental illness to craft, however loosely, a character teetering on the edge and a story close to his own world. Related Stories News Snow Leopard Sisters On Disappearance Of Guardian Of The Mountains - SXSW First Look Festivals Sean Evans Looks Back On 10-Years Of Hot Ones - SXSW Studio Here he plays a young man named Sam, distraught over losing his job as a paralegal, in the midst of a panic attack, and in session with his psychiatrist, Fred Judd Hirsch when we meet him. As he leaves the office, Freds receptionist and wife as it turns out Helen Andrea Martin takes pity on him and, needing a babysitter for her three granddaughters, enlists him for the job. Although he isnt exactly nanny or manny material, he gives it a shot. The father David Alessandro Nivola is in deep need of help and welcomes him into the apartment of kid mayhem as he leaves for the night. Davids marriage to the sometimes absent Dianne Amanda Peet is rocky to say the least, and he is about to go on a world tour with his band so Sam finds himself with a bigger gig than imagined. He also finds himself eventually bonding with Dianne, a TV actress whose career like her marriage has also hit the rocks. Her own mental illness and depression oddly matches Sams and the new manny finds himself growing closer to her just as he gets invited to join the extended family gathering for the summer on Marthas Vineyard, with crush Dianne, her husband, their kids and two sets of grandparents including Sams psychiatrist in tow no less. Watch on Deadline Shear has crafted a classic kind of family dynamic for this kind of smart, dialogue-driven comedy but he shows a great deal of promise in carefully keeping the inherent drama beneath the surface, particularly involving mental illness and depression, without using any of it as the butt of a joke. These characters and their deep anxieties and life problems feel very real. Shear also shows promise as a talented director of fellow actors while also carving himself a major role as Allen often did. The casting here is perfection. Peet, out of films in the past few years, is thankfully back in style with a role she makes her own, giving this drifting soul real gravitas and poignancy. Nivola also hits the right notes as a man trying to be a good father in a situation where the mother just isnt there completely and his career takes him on the road. You cant ask for a better supporting cast than the likes of Hirsch, and the wonderful Bob Balaban as the other grandfather whose extremely negative attitude toward interloper Sam is hilarious. Martin also dives in with relish here, and other well-known actors turn up including Holland Taylor for a brief scene as another psychiatrist. In the end, however, this is Shears show, both in front of and behind the camera, and if Fantasy Life is any indication, he has a bright future with both. Producers are Charlie Alderman, Chris Dodds, Phil Keefe, Peet, Emily McCann Lesser, David Bernon and Sam Slate.

While this shift is giving artists more independence, the big caveat is they first have to prove themselves to the public. Heres the truth Artists and creators have never had this much power over their own destinies. Were entering a new era, one I like to call hybrid drinking, where consumers are redefining what it means to raise a glass. Feedback can be hard to listen to, but its almost always valuable. Success isnt about a single viral moment or a trending post. Its about credibility, craftsmanship and long-term impact  whether youre an athlete, musician or brand.

By Angelique Kuiper For as long as digital culture has existed, going viral has been the ultimate prize. But ironically, the relentless pursuit of virality may be stifling our creativity rather than fuelling it. Success isnt about a single viral moment or a trending post. Its about credibility, craftsmanship and long-term impact  whether youre an athlete, musician or brand. Ive seen talented musicians wrestle with their artistic vision while trying to appease the algorithm. Brands dilute their messaging to reach the widest audience possible. Creators burn out, chasing trends instead of passion. And brands suffer immense backlash for misjudging cultural sensitivities. Sure, going viral has its appeal. Who wouldnt want their work to reach millions? But lets be honest, the most impactful creativity comes from a place of passion and authenticity, not calculation. Sometimes, brands go viral without even trying  simply because they resonate with people in a real way or offer exceptional workmanship. Heres a couple of examples of how genuine moments not calculated strategies have led to viral success A simple TikTok video of Nathan Apodaca skateboarding, sipping Ocean Spray Cran-Raspberry, and vibing to Fleetwood Macs Dreams became an instant sensation, getting over 80 million views. The feel-good clip felt effortless and real, leading to A TikTok moms video of her Stanley cup surviving a car fire went viral overnight and the tumbler became an internet obsession. Seizing the moment, Stanley gifted her a new car, fuelling the buzz. They also jumped on the opportunity to create new collabs and themed designs. The result? Both cases prove that the most powerful viral moments happen naturally  when a brand taps into culture at just the right time. Editors picks The 100 Best TV Episodes of All Time The 250 Greatest Albums of the 21st Century So Far The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time The 200 Greatest Singers of All Time The Rolling Stone Culture Council is an invitation-only community for Influencers, Innovators and Creatives. Do I qualify? Jumping on trends can be tempting, but when brands misjudge cultural sentiment and miss the mark, virality can turn into a PR disaster. On International Womens Day, Burger King UK tweeted Women belong in the kitchen. Their intent was to promote a scholarship for female chefs, but the execution backfired. Most people only saw the headline and not the full context  leading to immediate backlash. The tweet was deleted, an apology was issued, and the campaign became a cautionary tale on shock-value marketing. Pepsis ad showed Kendall Jenner solving a protest by handing a police officer a Pepsi  aiming to convey a message of unity. Instead, it was seen as trivializing real social justice movements like Black Lives Matter. The ad was pulled within 24 hours, sparking one of Pepsis biggest PR crises.

Taylor! Dylan! F1 Drivers Reveal Favorite Musical Artists Ahead of New Race Season The Best Bose Soundbar Is Down to Its Lowest Price Since Black Friday These two examples show how tone-deaf marketing can destroy trust. Brands need to be in tune with culture and avoid forced social relevance and anything too controversial or shock tactics that come across as insincere or offensive. Its time to shift the narrative. Instead of chasing fleeting moments of virality, lets focus on authentic storytelling that resonates, consistent excellence that builds long-term loyalty and cultural awareness that prevents backlash. If a trend aligns with your brand, jump on it  but with caution. But if your goal is simply to go viral, youre missing the point. Because the best viral moments arent forced they happen when brands create something that truly matters, when consumers generate unprompted content that resonates, and when brands are on point with cultural trends. Is it possible to create virality? Yes. But, dont force it. Virality isnt a strategy  its a byproduct of real connection. We want to hear it. Send us a tip using our anonymous form.
