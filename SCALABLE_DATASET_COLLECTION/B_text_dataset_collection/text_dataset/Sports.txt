The tight end position doesnt have much to like from a fantasy perspective regarding free agents, but it did gain a big name on Thursday. After trading Christian Kirk to Houston, the Jaguars cut their starting tight end, Evan Engram. The move saves Jacksonville around 6 million in cap space and makes Brenton Strange a potential fantasy sleeper in 2025 drafts. Engram is coming off a down year, playing in just nine games due to injuries and averaging a modest 9.9 fantasy points. Thats almost four fewer points per game compared to the 13.6 points he averaged in the previous season. It was also his lowest point average since 2021. Still, Engram will draw plenty of interest from tight-end-needy teams around the league. Heres a list of five teams that could use Engram and where he would retain his fantasy value as we head into the 2025 NFL campaign. In this scenario, Engram would sign with a Chargers team that could use an upgrade at tight end. Sorry, Will Dissly. Remember, Bolts offensive coordinator Greg Roman has had a lot of statistical success with tight ends Vernon Davis, Mark Andrews in his systems over the years, and Engram is the type of tight end who could become very valuable in the passing game for Justin Herbert. Engram would be in the fantasy TE1 conversation with the Chargers. Broncos head coach Sean Payton has had success with tight ends in his offenses Jimmy Graham comes to mind, and Engram would be a nice addition. None of the tight ends on the teams current roster warrant much excitement in fantasy leagues. Engram would be a nice outlet for their young, talented quarterback, Bo Nix. While the Broncos could go after a high-end tight end in the first round of the NFL Draft, Engram is also a solid option. The Colts havent had a great fantasy tight end in years, and the addition of Engram would be an upgrade. Mo Alie-Cox and Kylen Granson are both free agents, so the veteran could come in and be the starter and a reliable option for projected starter Anthony Richardson. The Colts do have some nice weapons at wideout in Michael Pittman Jr., Josh Downs and AD Mitchell, but I could still see Engram catching 50-plus passes in this offense. Hed also get a chance to exact some revenge on the team that cut him, the Jaguars, twice a year. The Jets have rarely had a fantasy-relevant tight end, but they do have a need at the position. Tyler Conklin is a free agent, and the team is thin on pass catchers after cutting ties with Davante Adams. Allen Lazard has also been allowed to seek a trade, so Engram is a nice option who could see plenty of targets in their offense. In New York, depending on who is playing quarterback, Engram would remain a fantasy option in the later rounds. The Bengals have been playing tight end roulette, as the team has signed Irv Smith Jr. and Mike Gesicki to short-term deals recently. With Gesicki heading into free agency, Cincinnati could continue this trend and sign Engram. Gesicki scored just two touchdowns last season, but he was targeted 83 times and finished with 665 receiving yards. Had he scored four times, Gesicki would have been the TE11. That proves theres tight end upside in Cincy. Michael Fabiano is a fantasy football analyst for Sports Illustrated.

Denver Nuggets center Nikola Jokic currently sits behind Oklahoma City Thunders Shai Gilgeous-Alexander in the 2025 NBA MVP odds, but Kevin Durant does not want to hear Jokic referred to as an underdog. Though Jokic trails in the MVP race, Durant says that Jokic cannot be an underdog. Im not gonna let yall keep doing that. Jokic never is an underdog, any situation. Stop, Durant said on Friday. Kevin Durant on the Jokic-SGA MVP race Jokic never is an underdog, any situation.Jokic can never be an underdog again. That shit was out the window his first MVP. pic.twitter.com81f7jZDXt7 Durant does not necessarily think Jokic should or will win MVP over Gilgeous-Alexander, but believes Jokic cannot be considered an underdog. Jokic can never be an underdog again, he said. That s--- was out the window his first MVP. It certainly is hard to view Jokic as an underdog. Jokic has won three NBA MVP awards over the last four seasons and an NBA championship, making him the most dominant player in the league throughout this stretch. Jokic also just made league history over Durant and the Phoenix Suns on Friday by becoming the first player to score at least 30 points with 20 or more rebounds and assists in a game as he recorded 31 points, 21 rebounds, and 22 assists in a 149-141 win over the Suns. Gilgeous-Alexander, who leads the NBA in scoring and is having a phenomenal season, could very well go on to win the NBA MVP award, but Jokic is still a strong contender. Even if Jokic doesnt win, he still has recorded MVP-worthy numbers, making it hard for him to be looked at as an underdog. feed Eva Geitheim is a contributor to the Breaking and Trending News team at Sports Illustrated.

Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Xavier Worthy is not currently set to face charges after he was arrested on an assault charge Friday night in Texas. The 21-year-old Worthy was charged with assault of a family or house member and impeding the breathing or circulation, which is a third-degree felony assault charge that is committed by intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly impeding the normal breathing or circulation of the blood of the person by applying pressure to the persons throat or neck or by blocking the persons nose or mouth. The offense was punishable with a sentence of two to 10 years of jail time andor a fine not to exceed 10,000. However, as of Saturday afternoon, Worthys jail record had been updated to dismisseddeclined. Williamson County District Attorney Shawn Dick told the Austin American-Statesman that his office would not be taking the case barring further developments. After further investigation by the Williamson County Sheriffs Office and further discussion with a third-party witness, Mr. Worthy and his attorneys, this case is being declined at this time pending completion of the investigation by the Williamson County Sheriffs Office, reads an email from Dicks office. Mr. Worthy and his lawyers are fully cooperating with this investigation. We will continue to evaluate the case. As is our practice with all declines, should you develop additional information indicative of probable cause in this case, our office will consider that information and may present the case at that time to a Williamson County Grand Jury. Attorneys for Worthy said in a statement Saturday afternoon that a woman Worthy was in a relationship with had made a number of extortive efforts prior to resorting to this baseless allegation against the receiver. The statement also said Worthy had previously hired a private investigator. We are aware of the allegation that led to Mr. Worthys arrest, the statement said. We are working with law enforcement in Williamson County to ensure they have the benefits of the totality of circumstances that led to this allegation. The complainant was asked multiple times over the last two weeks to vacate Mr. Worthys residence upon discovery of her infidelity, which a private investigator has video evidence of. She has refused to vacate the residence and made a number of extortive efforts prior to resorting to this baseless allegation against Mr. Worthy. The complainant further destroyed a room in the residence, scratched Mr. Worthys face and ripped out parts of his hair, which there is photographic evidence of. Mr. Worthy told law enforcement at the time of the incident he did not want to press charges against the complainant. We will continue to cooperate with Williamson County authorities as we have full faith their thorough investigation will support Mr. Worthys innocence. We are aware and gathering information, the Chiefs said in a statement Saturday morning before Worthys jail record was updated. We are aware of the matter and have been in contact with the club, the NFL said in a statement. The Chiefs drafted Worthy out of the University of Texas after trading up in the first round of the 2024 NFL Draft. He caught 59 passes for 638 yards and six touchdowns during his rookie NFL season before setting the NFL combine record for the fastest 40-yard dash. After he was used sparingly at the start of the season, Worthy emerged as the Chiefs most dependable wide receiver as Hollywood Brown returned from a shoulder injury and Rashee Rice missed much of the season with a knee injury.

The Lakers had the look of a contender before they ran into the defending champion Celtics and LeBron James suffered a groin injury halfway through the fourth quarter. Thompson was still in the game with the Rockets up by 30. Golden State Warriors guard Steph Curry reached a historic NBA career-scoring milestone against the Detroit Pistons on Saturday at Chase Center.
