Venture and growth investors invested 90 billion in European startups in 2022  marking a 25 decline from Europes 2021 funding peak of 119 billion. Much of the slowdown was concentrated in the second half of 2022, according to an analysis of Crunchbase data. And over this past year, late-stage funding took the biggest hit, having grown more than threefold year over year in 2021. Grow your revenue with all-in-one prospecting solutions powered by the leader in private-company data. Despite the decline in funding, 2022 is still significantly higher than annual funding in prior years, with 2022 close to double the 46 billion in funding raised in 2020. It appears that Europe has weathered the downturn better than other regions. Venture funding did not fall as sharply as North America or Asia in 2022  markets which each declined between 36 and 39, respectively, year over year. Europe has grown from a smaller foothold over the past decade compared to these leading regions  and gained a greater share of funding in the past two years, as it shot up in 2021 and did not pull back as sharply in 2022. This increase as a proportion of global funding, however, might not hold up in 2023. Europe in general has lagged behind the U.S., said Hussein Kanji from Hoxton Ventures. Theres a realistic chance that the slowdown might not really trigger fully in Europe until Q1 2023, he said, noting that Europe fluctuates more with the markets. When times are good it goes up higher than expected, and I suspect when times are low it will go lower than expected. So how does the slowdown in European venture funding look when broken down on a quarter-by-quarter basis during 2022? Funding for the fourth quarter was close to flat quarter over quarter and down 46 year over year. Again, Europe did not scale back as much as other leading regions, which declined from 58 to 63 this past quarter for the same time period. The biggest cutback year over year for the fourth quarter was at early-stage funding in European startups  from 10 billion in Q4 2021 to 5 billion this past quarter. The dramatic drop at early stage is a signal that investors are adopting a wait-and-see approach to this market. According to Kanji, There isnt very much in the way of Series B, Series C, D right now in Europe. Its really slowed down. He acknowledged that investors seem to be oriented toward earlier fundings at seed. The slowdown at seed-stage funding is also deepening, but less than the other funding stages. Seed declined by 37 year over year in the fourth quarter, totaling 1.8 billion. The fourth quarter of 2021 was around 3 billion for seed fundings. Late-stage funding was flat quarter over quarter, having already dropped in the third quarter. Late-stage funding was down 45 year over year for the fourth quarter, reaching 9.4 billion compared to 17 billion in Q4 2021. Whether the gains that Europe has made over the past two years will hold will be interesting to watch in 2023. Late-stage funding grew threefold year over year in 2021. As global growth investors step back from investing, it is likely to continue to scale back in 2023. The venture community in Europe has raised more funding in recent years, primarily focused on early-stage funding. The influx of U.S. venture capital in the market  whilst they are here to stay  have the majority of their portfolio in the U.S. market, which could take some attention away from Europe in the shorter term. Whether the slowdown in Europe is lagging behind other leading markets and will show larger declines or is on a new footing will be interesting to watch in the volatile markets of 2023. The data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on reported data. Data reported is as of Jan. 4, 2023. Note that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarteryear. The most recent quarteryear will increase over time relative to previous quarters. For funding counts, we notice a strong data lag, especially at the seed and early stages, by as much as 30 percent to 40 percent a year out. Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported.

U.S. tech layoffs appeared to surge this week, with reports of more than 6,000 jobs on the chopping block. Phoenix-based Onsemi Intelligent Technology led with a reported 2,400 workers facing job cuts, which works out to about 9 of its workforce. Other larger cuts came from San Francisco-based design software maker Autodesk, which is also reportedly cutting about 9 of its workforce, or 1,350 jobs, and Palo Alto-based personal computer maker HP, which said it will lay off up to 2,000 additional workers as part of a restructuring plan announced in 2022 that affected about 6,000 of its staff. Since this is a global cut, its unclear exactly how many U.S. workers at the 86-year-old company are affected. Cybersecurity provider Skybox Security reported it has laid off all 300 of its employees, with 200 of those workers belonging to its U.S. workforce. Based in Israel, the company is in the final stages of liquidating, selling its tech and business to Bostons Tufin. It had previously raised nearly 335 million from investors, per Crunchbase. The healthcare sector is also losing another company via a total closure HerMD, a provider of comprehensive health, beauty and wellness services for women, said its calling it quits. According to a report, the Cincinnati-based startup cited ongoing challenges in health care as the reason for its shutdown and will close its doors on March 21. The startup had raised 28.2 million from investors, according to Crunchbase. The following companies were added to the tracker this week Layoffs during the week ended Feb. 28, 2025 At least 6,071 U.S. tech sector employees were laid off or scheduled for layoffs, per a Crunchbase News tally. In 2024 At least 95,667 workers at U.S.-based tech companies lost their jobs in 2024, according to a Crunchbase News tally. In 2023 More than 191,000 workers in U.S.-based tech companies or tech companies with a large U.S. workforce were laid off in mass job cuts. In 2022 More than 93,000 jobs were slashed from public and private tech companies in the U.S. This tracker includes layoffs conducted by U.S.-based companies or those with a strong U.S. presence and is updated at least weekly. Weve included both startups and publicly traded, tech-heavy companies. Weve also included companies based elsewhere that have a sizable team in the United States, such as Klarna, even when its unclear how much of the U.S. workforce has been affected by layoffs. Layoff and workforce figures are best estimates based on reporting. We source the layoffs from media reports, our own reporting, social media posts and layoffs.fyi, a crowdsourced database of tech layoffs. We recently updated our layoffs tracker to reflect the most recent round of layoffs each company has conducted. This allows us to quickly and more accurately track layoff trends, which is why you might notice some changes in our most recent numbers. If an employee headcount cannot be confirmed to our standards, we note it as unclear. A layoff can be either a permanent termination of someones employment  usually for cost-saving reasons  or a temporary one because theres not enough work to justify a full workforce. Tech company layoffs generally fall into the permanent category. A mass layoff is when a significant number of a companys employees are cut in a short period of time, often as a result of economic conditions. Tech layoffs started to surge in 2022 and continued in 2023 and 2024. Companies have given various reasons for conducting layoffs. Some companies  especially those in the e-commerce sector  nearly doubled their employee headcount to meet consumer demand during the COVID-19 pandemics stay-at-home mandates, and later found that they were overstaffed as daily life returned to normal. Large tech employers such as Salesforce and Google parent Alphabet noted that their post-pandemic layoffs followed several years of rapid hiring fueled by fast growth  between 2019 and 2022, some companies nearly doubled their employee headcount. Some large tech companies also cited slowing sales and fears of a recession as reasons for downsizing. Venture-backed startups, meanwhile, also cut jobs as a way to cut costs and preserve their cash reserves, as venture funding fell significantly after the peak in 2021. Some startups that ran out of cash and couldnt raise new funding found themselves filing for bankruptcy or shutting down. Intel Corp. laid off the largest number of people among U.S. tech employers in 2024, by our count. The semiconductor giant laid off more than 15,000 employees last year. It was followed closely by electric-car maker Tesla, which cut more than 14,000 roles, and networking company Cisco, with more than 10,000 total roles cut. In 2023, Amazon layoffs led the numbers with 16,000 roles cut. Layoffs at Alphabet, the parent company of Google, totaled about 12,000, and Microsofts layoffs totaled about 10,000 workers in 2023, as did Facebook parent Metas layoffs. Many venture-backed tech startups have also done layoffs as venture capital investment has fallen sharply since the peak in 2021, and falling startup valuations factor into their decisions to conduct layoffs. Yes, more layoffs are likely coming. While there are signs that the volume of layoffs is tapering, experts we talked to expect job cuts in the tech sector to continue for the foreseeable future as large tech companies and startups continue to battle economic headwinds. Seed and early-stage startups in particular may continue to conduct layoffs in an attempt to extend their cash runways in a difficult venture funding environment. Tech layoffs noticeably increased at the start of 2022, ramped up in 2023, and have continued in 2024. Signs that may indicate a company is more likely to conduct layoffs include Layoffs declined in 2024 compared to the previous year, but are expected to continue into 2025, although likely not at the level seen in 2023. Startups that need to preserve cash to extend their runways are more likely to conduct layoffs. Tech layoffs will likely slow when venture capital funding increases and the startup economy stabilizes, as well as when market conditions improve and more startups gain liquidity via IPOs. Startups that raised capital during the venture funding heyday at inflated valuations in 2021 are more likely to need to conduct layoffs if theyre not able to sustain their previous valuations or growth projections. Tech layoffs started surging in the 2022 market correction, with an estimated 93,000 U.S. tech workers laid off that year. That figure more than doubled in 2023, with around 200,000 U.S. tech employees laid off, according to our Tech Layoffs Tracker. Layoffs abated again in 2024, with around 95,000 reported tech layoffs. Keep in mind, many companies dont report detailed layoffs figures, and some companies continue hiring after cuts for positions deemed more beneficial to the business. No, according to experts in the sector, who say a sale is unlikely to solve a tech companys cash-flow issues. This is especially true as fewer startup MA deals are happening in the current downturn. Tech layoffs have hit across departments at many companies. Many layoffs from the large tech giants were software engineers. Startups tend to be more likely to retain engineers in favor of doing layoffs in their talent and recruiting, marketing and other departments. Google cut roles in its sales, recruiting, product and engineering teams. Amazon layoffs included jobs in its AWS cloud unit, at its social video platform Twitch, and in its advertising department. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the companys recruiting department would be the first to see job cuts.

Global startup funding picked up in the second quarter, reaching 79 billion  rising 16 quarter over quarter and 12 from the 71 billion invested in Q2 2023. Mega-rounds  fundings 100 million and above  accounted for much of the increase this past quarter. Funding to companies in AI more than doubled quarter over quarter to 24 billion  representing 30 of all dollars invested, the largest quarter for AI funding in recent years. And there are signs that larger MA deals increased in Q2, providing much-needed liquidity to venture capital markets. Crunchbase data shows we are eight to nine quarters into the current funding decline. While this past quarter was amongst the highest for funding since Q1 2023, it is not necessarily a signal of a venture market comeback. Since 2023, funding has fluctuated quarter by quarter based on an increase in large growth rounds to pre-IPO companies and to companies in the AI sector. This past quarter is no exception. AI was the leading sector for the first time since the launch of OpenAIs ChatGPT, based on an analysis of Crunchbase data. Q2s total of 24 billion was the largest amount raised in a quarter in the AI sector in recent years, despite investor concerns about revenue and high valuations. Five out of six billion-dollar funding rounds went to AI companies. Elon Musks xAI raised 6 billion, and AI infrastructure provider CoreWeave raised 1.1 billion. Automated driving company Wayve, data preparation company Scale AI and AI biotech company Xaira Therapeutics each raised billion-dollar rounds. Outside of AI, cybersecurity company Wiz raised a billion-dollar round. Healthcare and biotech was the second-largest sector, raising 17 billion. Hardware companies  in large part due to AI infrastructure and semiconductor fundings  raised 11 billion. Financial services companies, typically in the top two sectors in the peak market of 2021, raised 9.8 billion. Despite the uptick in the last quarter, funding for the first half of this year did not increase. Global funding reached 147 billion in H1, marking a 5 decline year over year, down from the 154 billion invested in H1 2023. And funding was flat compared to the second half of 2023. Late-stage funding reached 36 billion, up from 33 billion in the second quarter of 2023. Large fundings went to AI foundation model and AI infrastructure companies, autonomous driving, electric vehicles, cybersecurity, drug development and quantum computing companies. Early-stage funding was up in Q2, in large part due to the funding to xAI. Outside of the xAI financing, funding was in line quarter over quarter and year over year. Large early-stage rounds also went to biotech, lending, AI and renewable energy companies. Seed funding was the most robust through the downturn. It has remained stable over the last five quarters, with around 8 billion invested at seed per quarter. Seed has come down by around a third from the peak quarters, dropping far less in this slower funding environment than early and late-stage funding amounts. Through the downturn, based on an analysis of Crunchbase data, companies are staying at the seed stage for longer, while the bar to raise Series A funding has gone up. Notable large deals on the software MA front this past quarter include security company CyberArks bid for identity management company Venafi for 1.5 billion. Intelligence platform AlphaSense has plans to acquire competitor Tegus for 930 million. And RunAI, a company that improves GPU performance, is to be acquired by Nvidia for 700 million. Despite the pickup in venture in Q2 2024 and increased funding to AI, the overall market outlook has not shifted. Concerns about revenue growth, a challenging environment for startups raising funding, a higher bar at each stage and a slower exit environment continue to impact venture capital allocation. In the meantime, signs of a more active MA market would address some of the uncertainty about venture returns. The data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on reported data. Data reported is as of July 7, 2024. Note that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarteryear. Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price. We have made a change to how we include corporate funding rounds in our reporting as of January 2023. Corporate rounds are only included if a company has raised an equity funding at seed through a venture series funding round. Seed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at 3 million USD or as-converted USD equivalent or less. Early-stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above 3 million, and those less than or equal to 15 million. Late-stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the Series Letter naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above 15 million. Technology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a venture round. So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.
