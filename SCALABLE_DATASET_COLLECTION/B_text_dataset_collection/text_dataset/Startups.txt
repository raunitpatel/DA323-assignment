Startup Eikon Therapeutics raised one of the biggest biotech rounds thus far in this young year. The Hayward, California-based drug startup closed on nearly 351 million in a Series D from the likes of Lux Capital and Alexandria Venture Investments. The round is the second biggest for a biotech startup this year, behind only London-based Verdiva Bio, a company creating treatments for obesity and cardiometabolic diseases, which raised a 411 million Series A in January. Eikon uses super-resolution microscopy to discover the effects of drugs on live cells. The company is developing therapies for a variety of cancers, including breast, ovarian, prostate and melanoma. Founded in 2019, the company has now raised 1.1 billion, per Crunchbase. Eikon has made remarkable progress in advancing a pivotal-stage clinical pipeline and early-stage development program powered by our single-molecule tracking technology and the deep expertise of our multidisciplinary team, said chairman and CEO Dr. Roger Perlmutter in a release. With clinical studies now operating in 28 countries, across 5 continents, we are accelerating the development of much-needed therapies while continuing to expand our research and development capabilities. This is just the latest big round for Eikon, which raised a 517.8 million Series B financing from nearly 20 different investors, including funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, back in 2022. Biotech startups this year have raised almost 7 billion so far  thanks in part to some large nine-figure rounds. Last year, biotech startups raised more than 35 billion in total. Illustration Dom Guzman Stay up to date with recent funding rounds, acquisitions, and more with the Crunchbase Daily.

After four consecutive down quarters, North American startup investors havent staged a definitive comeback yet. However, first-quarter numbers do show pockets of resilience, even as the general funding climate remains constrained. North American funding in the first quarter reached 46.3 billion  a decline of 46 from the same period last year. Thats even including a reported 10 billion investment into OpenAI  largely from Microsoft  and a 6.5 billion round for payments giant Stripe. Without those two large deals, Q1 venture funding would have been down even more dramatically, with a more than 60 decline from the same period last year. Grow your revenue with all-in-one prospecting solutions powered by the leader in private-company data. For a sense of how the just-ended quarter compares across all stages, we charted funding totals for the past nine quarters below As you can see above, early-stage and seed-stage investment were both down quarter over quarter, along with reported deal counts. A frozen IPO market and wilted public tech valuations also contributed to suppressing later-stage dealmaking. For more detail, we break funding activity down by stage below, and also take a look at exit activity, which was also on the muted side. Everything starts at seed stage, so well begin there too. For Q1, reported seed-stage startup investment totaled 3 billion, the lowest quarterly tally in over two years. Overall, investment was down 9 quarter over quarter and 48 year over year. For perspective, we chart out investment for the past five quarters below Even though things were down overall, we did see some companies raise big seed rounds. Examples include Descope, a developer of authentication technology that pulled in 53 million, Plai Labs, a social platform that picked up 32 million, and Type One Energy, a fusion startup that landed 29 million. Early-stage investment was down too. In total, investors put 13.3 billion into deals at this stage in Q1, down 10 from the prior quarter and 53 from one year ago. Deal counts also declined. To add some context, we chart out deal counts and funding totals for the past five quarters below In analyses of Series A and Series B funding trends published last month, we noted that declines are more pronounced for some sectors than others. Fintech, consumer products and Web3, in particular, are seeing less investment at the early stage. Even with fewer big checks being cut, we did still see some big rounds. The largest funding recipients included Adept AI, a machine learning startup that raised a 350 million Series B, Our Next Energy, an energy storage company that secured 300 million in Series B financing, and Paradigm, a clinical trials platform that pulled in a 203 million Series A. Next up is late stage, which accounted for the majority of investment in the first quarter. Per Crunchbase data, 30 billion went to late-stage and technology growth rounds in Q1. Thats more than double Q4 totals, but still well below year-ago levels. For perspective, we chart out deal counts and funding totals for the past five quarters below A cursory look at the chart above creates the impression that late stage is getting its groove back after a couple rough quarters. However, a closer analysis of the quarters biggest deals challenges that narrative. Neither of the two biggest rounds of the quarter are traditional venture rounds for hot rising stars in the startup scene. OpenAI, which reportedly received a 10 billion investment backed by Microsoft, describes itself as a capped profit company governed by a nonprofit. Stripe, meanwhile, closed its massive 6.5 billion Series I in March at a valuation of 50 billion  far below its 95 billion peak value. Beyond those two deals, there were no late-stage investments that came close to cracking the billion-dollar threshold. The next-biggest investments included a 500 million Series E for human resources platform Rippling, a 500 venture round for AI and quantum computing company SandboxAQ, and a 375 million Series C for kidney disease treatment provider Monogram Health. Things were also comparatively muted on the exit front. With the IPO environment still sluggish, we didnt see any debuts in Q1 from companies lauded a few months ago as potential 2023 IPO candidates. However, a few venture-backed companies did make it to market during the quarter, including On the acquisition side, meanwhile, 2023 has not been a very active year for big-ticket startup deals so far. However, we did see some good-sized MA exits in the first quarter, including So whats the broad takeaway from our Q1 numbers? For those hoping to see a big turnaround after several quarters of declining investment, that hasnt panned out. However, its clear startup investors arent throwing in the towel either. Big rounds are getting done, hot areas like AI remain appealing, and some exits are still happening. Will Q2 be the big turnaround? So far, markets are off to a rocky start in April. But who knows. Weve still got months to go, and the startup funding scene is, if nothing else, reliably unpredictable. The data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on reported data. Data reported is as of April 3, 2023. Note that data lags are most pronounced at the earliest stages of venture activity, with seed funding amounts increasing significantly after the end of a quarteryear. Please note that all funding values are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise noted. Crunchbase converts foreign currencies to U.S. dollars at the prevailing spot rate from the date funding rounds, acquisitions, IPOs and other financial events are reported. Even if those events were added to Crunchbase long after the event was announced, foreign currency transactions are converted at the historic spot price. We have made a change to how we include corporate funding rounds in our reporting as of January 2023. Corporate rounds are only included if a company has raised an equity funding at seed through a venture series funding round. Seed and angel consists of seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Crunchbase also includes venture rounds of unknown series, equity crowdfunding and convertible notes at 3 million USD or as-converted USD equivalent or less. Early-stage consists of Series A and Series B rounds, as well as other round types. Crunchbase includes venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above 3 million, and those less than or equal to 15 million. Late-stage consists of Series C, Series D, Series E and later-lettered venture rounds following the Series Letter naming convention. Also included are venture rounds of unknown series, corporate venture and other rounds above 15 million. Technology growth is a private-equity round raised by a company that has previously raised a venture round. So basically, any round from the previously defined stages.

By Alberto Onetti Tunisia, often overlooked in discussions of Africas burgeoning tech scene, quietly boasts a vibrant ecosystem ripe with potential. While giants such as South Africa and Nigeria command headlines, the small North African nation is strategically positioning itself as a vital bridge between Africa and Europe. With a surge in startups, increasing government support, and a unique geographical advantage, Tunisia is poised to become a key player in the continents innovation landscape. The question is Can it make the leap from promising up-and-comer to a true scaleup hub  and what can other emerging tech ecosystems learn from its progress? Tunisia sits at the early stage of the Innovation Ecosystem Life Cycle Curve, alongside thousands of other regional hubs. When analyzing an emerging ecosystem, there are two perspectives Together with Crunchbase, we conducted an in-depth analysis of Tunisias startup ecosystem, which is making significant strides to establish itself as a regional tech hub. The Tech Scaleup Tunisia  2025 Report, produced by my organization, Mind the Bridge, with the support of ICC Tunisia and Terna Innovation Zone, presents full data and was unveiled in Tunis on Feb. 12. As of 2025, Tunisia hosts 17 scaleups and more than 1,450 startups, ranking among Africas top 10 destinations for tech innovation. The country is also home to one of the continents brightest tech success stories Instadeep, which raised 100 million-plus in funding and was acquired by BioNTech in one of Africas largest-ever tech MA deals. But this is just the tip of the innovation iceberg. Beneath the surface lies a multifaceted ecosystem that includes Tunisias innovation push began in the early 2000s with a series of government-led initiatives, including While Africas largest innovation ecosystems  South Africa, Egypt, Nigeria and Kenya  each host around 150 scaleups with over 2 billion in capital raised, Tunisia belongs to a second-tier group alongside Morocco, Mauritius, Ghana, Seychelles and Uganda. Despite its relatively small population 12.5 million, Tunisia with 17 scaleups and nearly 1,500 startups has 0.14 scaleups and 12.5 startups per 100,000 inhabitants. These figures align with regional leaders like Egypt and outperform neighbors Morocco and Algeria. In terms of capital allocation, Tunisia dedicates 0.4 of its GDP to innovation  double Morocco 0.2 and quadruple Algeria 0.1  though it still lags behind Egypt, which invests nearly twice as much. Tunisia has a real opportunity to become Northwest Africas scaleup hub  and more importantly, a bridge between Africa and Europe. The key challenge? Helping startups transition into scaleups. Successfully navigating this phase could spark a virtuous cycle, enhancing Tunisias regional and global relevance while attracting more investors and entrepreneurs. With the right mix of policy, capital and international collaboration, Tunisia could cement its position as a rising force in the African tech landscape. Alberto Onetti is chairman of Mind the Bridge and a professor at University of Insubria. He is a serial entrepreneur who has started three startups in his career, the last of which is Funambol, among the five Italian scaleups that have raised the largest amount of capital. He is recognized among the leading international experts in open innovation and has wide experience in setting up and managing open innovation projects  venture clients, venture builders, intrapreneurship, CVCs  with large multinational companies, as well as advising and training on this subject.

After many months of tightening their purse strings, North American startup investors loosened them up a bit in the first quarter. Altogether, venture funding in American and Canadian companies totaled 35.2 billion in Q1 of 2024, per Crunchbase data. Thats a gain of 14 from Q4, which was the slowest quarter in years. But while funding was up sequentially, investment is still down year over year. Late-stage funding in particular remains well below year-ago levels, while early stage has held up better. For perspective, we compared funding totals, color-coded by stage, over the past 13 quarters below. While spending rose sequentially in Q1, deal volume did not. Per Crunchbase data, investors participated in 2,435 known rounds at all stages in the course of the quarter. Thats a decline of 8 from the prior quarter and 34 from year-ago levels, as charted below. On the exit front, meanwhile, Q1 brought some renewed excitement to the moribund IPO market with well-received debuts of Reddit and Astera Labs. We also saw a few good-sized acquisitions. Below we take a look at both investment and exit activity in more detail, breaking down totals by stage, looking at significant rounds, and tallying up largest MA and public market exits. Well start with late-stage dealmaking, which still attracts more money than any other stage, even at the current, somewhat depressed levels. Altogether, 19 billion went into late-stage and technology growth rounds in North America in Q1, per Crunchbase data. Thats a bit of an uptick from the prior quarter, but still well below year-ago levels, as shown in the chart below. Deal counts also picked up a bit sequentially, with 265 late-stage and growth rounds reported for North American companies in Q1. The totals got a boost from some extra-large financings for a handful of companies, including But while jumbo-sized rounds did close over the course of the quarter, such deals remain far rarer than they were during the 2021 peak. Part of the reason is the highest-spending investors back then  SoftBank Vision Fund and Tiger Global Management  are much less active now. Activity in Q1 was pretty robust at early stage, boosted by big rounds for companies focused on biotech, artificial intelligence and climate tech. Total early-stage funding for the just-ended quarter came in at 13.2 billion  surpassing the prior two quarters. Round counts ticked down a bit, as average investment size rose. For perspective, we charted funding and round totals for the past five quarters below. Investors also backed some unusually large rounds at Series A and Series B. Standouts included Seed investment saw the sharpest quarterly decline of any stage, according to preliminary Crunchbase data. For Q1, a total of 3 billion went into reported seed, pre-seed and angel rounds. Thats a decline of 14 from the prior quarter and a drop of 23 from year-ago levels. Round counts fell too. For the full picture, we chart out total funding and the number of deals for the past five quarters below. Because some seed rounds are reported weeks or months after they close, we expect the Q1 total to rise a bit over time. However, its unlikely this will change the overall narrative of a down quarter. Although most seed deals are in the single-digit millions, we did see a few extra-large financings. One of the largest from Q1 was for Alys Pharmaceuticals, an immuno-dermatology startup that launched with 100 million in initial funding. Other big rounds went to Antithesis, a provider of AI-enabled quality assurance software that picked up 47 million, and Blue Laser Fusion, which raised 37.5 million to work on laser fusion technology. Of course, venture investors dont only put money into startups. They expect to get returns when those companies mature and go public or get acquired. As exit environments go, Q1 of 2024 wasnt especially terrible. The IPO market opened up for a couple of splashy debuts, and acquirers wrote a few big checks, as detailed below. The IPO market, which has been very sluggish for months, picked up in March with the much-anticipated debuts of Reddit and Astera Labs. Santa Clara, California-based Astera, a developer of data center connectivity technology with use cases in generative AI, made its splashy debut first on March 20. Shares soared in initial trading and continued to rise in the following days. Although off its peak, Astera recently had a market cap of more than 11 billion. San Francisco-based Reddit, known for its lively online discussion forums, began trading two days after Astera. After surging in the early days of trading, shares sank a bit. Nonetheless, Reddit recently managed to maintain a market cap around 7.5 billion. In addition to the two headlines, we also saw some smaller offerings by venture-backed companies including Kyverna Therapeutics, ArriVent Biopharma and FibroBiologics, which went public via direct listing. Acquirers also announced agreements to buy a number of venture-backed companies. Although in most cases prices were not disclosed, a few were made public. Of these, the largest included With Q1 now in the rearview mirror, its timely to consider what broad takeaways we can find in the data. All in all, wed say it wasnt the most rollicking quarter. But there were a few indicators to bolster optimists case for a recovering startup investment climate. For one, public investors showed there is appetite for large tech IPOs. And while weve seen better quarters for MA, we saw that acquirers are still willing to write big checks. Seeing early-stage investment continuing to rise over the course of several quarters also looks encouraging. Todays hot early-stage companies, the hope is, will become tomorrows sought-after IPOs. That said, the data wasnt strong enough to support the idea that startup investment is back in a big way. Investment is still far, far below the peak. Getting back there, if it happens at all, will require a long, uphill climb. The data contained in this report comes directly from Crunchbase, and is based on reported data. Data reported is as of April 3, 2024.
