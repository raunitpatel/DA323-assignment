What events happened on 2 March in history? We round up the events, births and deaths Nerveless general defies an army 10 times the size of his own In the first days of AD 537, the people of Rome waited nervously for attack. Once the capital of the worlds greatest empire, now a miserable, ruined shadow, the ancient city had long since yielded its role to Constantinople. In the fifth century it had fallen to the Goths, but at the end of 536 it was retaken by Constantinoples greatest general, Belisarius. But since Belisarius had only a few thousand men, he knew he faced a struggle to keep it. At last, on the second day of March, the enemy revealed themselves. From seven great camps overlooking the citys main gates, the Goths began their siege of Rome. Equipped with vast siege engines, their armies were 10 times bigger than Belisariuss little band. But even as the city began to starve, Belisarius refused to panic. His secretary, Procopius, even recorded that the general laughed on seeing the Goths great siege towers. He knew that reinforcements were on their way all he had to do was wait. When peace talks broke down, Belisarius took the initiative, sending his general John to seize the towns in the Goths rear. Some 374 days after the siege had begun, word reached the Goths that Rimini had fallen, leaving John barely a days march from their capital, Ravenna. As smoke rose from the Goths camps, Belisarius knew that his gamble had paid off. He waited until half the retreating Gothic forces were across the Milvian Bridge, and then ordered his troops out of the city. They killed thousands of Goths, and many more were drowned. Belisarius had won. For the time being at least, Rome remained Roman.  Written by Dominic Sandbrook Henry of Blois, bishop of Winchester, met the Empress Matilda in Winchester and agreed to support her claim to the English throne against his brother, King Stephen, who had been captured at Lincoln a month earlier.
