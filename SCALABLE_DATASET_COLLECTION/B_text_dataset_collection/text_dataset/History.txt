Subscribe to topic Subscribe to author Print Article John G. Burnett b. 11 December 1810 was a private in the US Army in 1838 when he was ordered to act as interpreter between US officials and the Cherokee during the forced removal of Native Americans now known as the Trail of Tears. On his 80th birthday, Burnett wrote a letter to his children describing his experiences. Walkway map at the Cherokee Removal Memorial ParkIts Only Make Believe CC BY-SA The Trail of Tears was a series of forced relocations of the Five Civilized Tribes  the Choctaw, Seminole, Muscogee Creek, Chickasaw, and Cherokee  between 1831 and 1850. Burnetts account has become a primary source on the Cherokee eviction of 1838, even though some scholars and historians discount it as self-serving or inaccurate. Scholar John Ehle, for example, comments A romantic concept of Indians evolved in the years following their removal from the Southeast. The Cherokee were generally pictured as living peacefully in their mountain home  though fewer than one in five lived in mountain areas their possession of black slaves was omitted from such portrayals, their shamans were exonerated their propensity for warfare was replaced with peaceful coexistence with Creek, Choctaw, Chickasaw, and the restDuring this period, to be a white man and to have taken part in the Indian wars became reprehensible and apologies and excuses were made by the veterans of Indian wars added to the embellishments. For instance, a letter often quoted as accurately describing the events of Cherokee removal in 1838 and 1839 was written in 1890, fifty years later, by a veteran of the United States Cavalry, John G. Burnett, who on his eightieth birthday sought to assure his grandchildren of his own purity of past actions. 393 Ehle, however, offers no evidence that Burnetts account is inaccurate, and, in fact, the Burnett account seems to be supported by Native American reports of the event, including that of the Cherokee woman Wahnenauhi who, according to Digital History, sent her account to the US Bureau of Indian Affairs Perish or remove! It might be  remove and perish! A long journey through the wilderness  could the little ones endure? And how about the sick? The old people and infirm, could they possibly endure the long tedious journey? Should they leave? This had been the home of their ancestors from time out of mind. Everything they held dear on earth was here, must they leave? The graves of their kindred forsaken would be desecrated by the hand of the White Man. The very air seemed filled with an undercurrent of inexpressible sadness and regret Some of the Cherokee remained in their homes and determined not to leave. For these, soldiers were sent by Georgia, and they were gathered up and driven, at the point of the bayonet, into camp with the others. They were not allowed to take any of their household stuff, but were compelled to leave as they were, with only the clothes which they had on. One old, very old, man asked the soldiers to allow him to pray one more time, with his family, in the dear old home, before he left it forever. The answer was, with a brutal oath, No! No time for prayers. Go! at the same time giving him a rude push toward the door. Indians were evicted, the whites entered, taking full possession of everything left. Digital History, 1 The accounts of Wahnenauhi and Burnett are understood as accurate because they are supported by the reports of others who experienced the same event or similar actions of the US government in the removal of Native Americans, whether the Navajo Long Walk of 1863-1866, the removal of the Cheyenne, Sioux, the Modoc, or the many, many others whose lands were taken by Euro-Americans with little, or no, compensation. The following is taken from the site Anchor A North Carolina History Online Resource Primary Source A Soldier Recalls the Trail of Tears Children This is my birthday, December 11, 1890, I am eighty years old today. I was born at Kings Iron Works in Sullivan County, Tennessee, December the 11th, 1810. I grew into manhood fishing in Beaver Creek and roaming through the forest hunting the deer and the wild boar and the timber wolf. Often spending weeks at a time in the solitary wilderness with no companions but my rifle, hunting knife, and a small hatchet that I carried in my belt in all of my wilderness wanderings. On these long hunting trips, I met and became acquainted with many of the Cherokee Indians, hunting with them by day and sleeping around their campfires by night. I learned to speak their language, and they taught me the arts of trailing and building traps and snares. On one of my long hunts in the fall of 1829, I found a young Cherokee who had been shot by a roving band of hunters and who had eluded his pursuers and concealed himself under a shelving rock. Weak from loss of blood, the poor creature was unable to walk and almost famished for water. I carried him to a spring, bathed and bandaged the bullet wound, and built a shelter out of bark peeled from a dead chestnut tree. I nursed and protected him feeding him on chestnuts and toasted deer meat. When he was able to travel, I accompanied him to the home of his people and remained so long that I was given up for lost. By this time, I had become an expert rifleman and fairly good archer and a good trapper and spent most of my time in the forest in quest of game. The removal of Cherokee Indians from their lifelong homes in the year of 1838 found me a young man in the prime of life and a Private soldier in the American Army. Being acquainted with many of the Indians and able to fluently speak their language, I was sent as interpreter into the Smoky Mountain Country in May 1838 and witnessed the execution of the most brutal order in the History of American Warfare. I saw the helpless Cherokees arrested and dragged from their homes and driven at the bayonet point into the stockades. And in the chill of a drizzling rain on an October morning I saw them loaded like cattle or sheep into six hundred and forty-five wagons and started toward the west. One can never forget the sadness and solemnity of that morning. Chief John Ross led in prayer and when the bugle sounded and the wagons started rolling many of the children rose to their feet and waved their little hands good-by to their mountain homes, knowing they were leaving them forever. Many of these helpless people did not have blankets and many of them had been driven from home barefooted. On the morning of November the 17th we encountered a terrific sleet and snow storm with freezing temperatures and from that day until we reached the end of the fateful journey on March the 26th, 1839, the sufferings of the Cherokees were awful. The trail of the exiles was a trail of death. They had to sleep in the wagons and on the ground without fire. And I have known as many as twenty-two of them to die in one night of pneumonia due to ill treatment, cold, and exposure. Among this number was the beautiful Christian wife of Chief John Ross. This noble hearted woman died a martyr to childhood, giving her only blanket for the protection of a sick child. She rode thinly clad through a blinding sleet and snowstorm, developed pneumonia and died in the still hours of a bleak winter night, with her head resting on Lieutenant Greggs saddle blanket. I made the long journey to the west with the Cherokees and did all that a private soldier could do to alleviate their sufferings. When on guard duty at night I have many times walked my beat in my blouse in order that some sick child might have the warmth of my overcoat. I was on guard duty the night Mrs. Ross died. When relieved at midnight, I did not retire, but remained around the wagon out of sympathy for Chief Ross, and at daylight was detailed by Captain McClellan to assist in the burial like the other unfortunates who died on the way. Her unconfined body was buried in a shallow grave by the roadside far from her native home, and the sorrowing Cavalcade moved on. Being a young man, I mingled freely with the young women and girls. I have spent many pleasant hours with them when I was supposed to be under my blanket, and they have many times sung their mountain songs for me, this being all that they could do to repay my kindness. And with all my association with Indian girls from October 1829 to March 26th, 1839, I did not meet one who was a moral prostitute. They are kind and tender hearted and many of them are beautiful. The only trouble that I had with anybody on the entire journey to the west was a brutal teamster by the name of Ben McDonal, who was using his whip on an old feeble Cherokee to hasten him into the wagon. The sight of that old and nearly blind creature quivering under the lashes of a bull whip was too much for me. I attempted to stop McDonal, and it ended in a personal encounter. He lashed me across the face, the wire tip on his whip cutting a bad gash in my cheek. The little hatchet that I had carried in my hunting days was in my belt and McDonal was carried unconscious from the scene. I was placed under guard but Ensign Henry Bullock and Private Elkanah Millard had both witnessed the encounter. They gave Captain McClellan the facts and I was never brought to trial. Years later I met 2nd Lieutenant Riley and Ensign Bullock at Bristol at John Robersons show, and Bullock jokingly reminded me that there was a case still pending against me before a court martial and wanted to know how much longer I was going to have the trial put off? McDonal finally recovered, and in the year 1851, was running a boat out of Memphis, Tennessee. The long painful journey to the west ended March 26th, 1839, with four-thousand silent graves reaching from the foothills of the Smoky Mountains to what is known as Indian territory in the West. And covetousness on the part of the white race was the cause of all that the Cherokees had to suffer. Ever since Ferdinand DeSoto made his journey through the Indian country in the year 1540, there had been a tradition of a rich gold mine somewhere in the Smoky Mountain Country, and I think the tradition was true. At a festival at Echota on Christmas night 1829, I danced and played with Indian girls who were wearing ornaments around their neck that looked like gold. In the year 1828, a little Indian boy living on Ward creek had sold a gold nugget to a white trader, and that nugget sealed the doom of the Cherokees. In a short time the country was overrun with armed brigands claiming to be government agents, who paid no attention to the rights of the Indians who were the legal possessors of the country. Crimes were committed that were a disgrace to civilization. Men were shot in cold blood, lands were confiscated. Homes were burned and the inhabitants driven out by the gold-hungry brigands.

Junaluska had taken 500 of the flower of his Cherokee scouts and helped Jackson to win the battle of the Horse Shoe, leaving 33 of them dead on the field. And in that battle Junaluska had drove his tomahawk through the skull of a Creek warrior, when the Creek had Jackson at his mercy. Chief John Ross sent Junaluska as an envoy to plead with President Jackson for protection for his people, but Jacksons manner was cold and indifferent toward the rugged son of the forest who had saved his life. He met Junaluska, heard his plea but curtly said, Sir, your audience is ended. There is nothing I can do for you. The doom of the Cherokee was sealed. Washington, D.C., had decreed that they must be driven West, and their lands given to the white man, and in May 1838, an army of 4000 regulars, and 3000 volunteer soldiers under command of General Winfield Scott, marched into the Indian country and wrote the blackest chapter on the pages of American history. Men working in the fields were arrested and driven to the stockades. Women were dragged from their homes by soldiers whose language they could not understand. Children were often separated from their parents and driven into the stockades with the sky for a blanket and the earth for a pillow. And often the old and infirm were prodded with bayonets to hasten them to the stockades. In one home death had come during the night. A little sad-faced child had died and was lying on a bear skin couch and some women were preparing the little body for burial. All were arrested and driven out leaving the child in the cabin. I dont know who buried the body. In another home was a frail mother, apparently a widow and three small children, one just a baby. When told that she must go, the mother gathered the children at her feet, prayed a humble prayer in her native tongue, patted the old family dog on the head, told the faithful creature good-by, with a baby strapped on her back and leading a child with each hand started on her exile. But the task was too great for that frail mother. A stroke of heart failure relieved her sufferings. She sunk and died with her baby on her back, and her other two children clinging to her hands. Chief Junaluska who had saved President Jacksons life at the battle of Horse Shoe witnessed this scene, the tears gushing down his cheeks and lifting his cap he turned his face toward the heavens and said, Oh my God, if I had known at the battle of the Horse Shoe what I know now, American history would have been differently written. At this time, 1890, we are too near the removal of the Cherokees for our young people to fully understand the enormity of the crime that was committed against a helpless race. Truth is, the facts are being concealed from the young people of today. School children of today do not know that we are living on lands that were taken from a helpless race at the bayonet point to satisfy the white mans greed. Future generations will read and condemn the act and I do hope posterity will remember that private soldiers like myself, and like the four Cherokees who were forced by General Scott to shoot an Indian Chief and his children, had to execute the orders of our superiors. We had no choice in the matter. Twenty-five years after the removal it was my privilege to meet a large company of the Cherokees in uniform of the Confederate Army under command of Colonel Thomas. They were encamped at Zollicoffer, and I went to see them. Most of them were just boys at the time of the removal but they instantly recognized me as the soldier that was good to us. Being able to talk to them in their native language I had an enjoyable day with them. From them I learned that Chief John Ross was still ruler in the nation in 1863. And I wonder if he is still living? He was a noble-hearted fellow and suffered a lot for his race. At one time, he was arrested and thrown into a dirty jail in an effort to break his spirit, but he remained true to his people and led them in prayer when they started on their exile. And his Christian wife sacrificed her life for a little girl who had pneumonia. The Anglo-Saxon race would build a towering monument to perpetuate her noble act in giving her only blanket for comfort of a sick child. Incidentally the child recovered, but Mrs. Ross is sleeping in an unmarked grave far from her native Smoky Mountain home. When Scott invaded the Indian country some of the Cherokees fled to caves and dens in the mountains and were never captured and they are there today. I have long intended going there and trying to find them, but I have put off going from year to year and now I am too feeble to ride that far. The fleeing years have come and gone, and old age has overtaken me. I can truthfully say that neither my rifle nor my knife were stained with Cherokee blood. I can truthfully say that I did my best for them when they certainly did need a friend. Twenty-five years after the removal I still lived in their memory as the soldier that was good to us. However, murder is murder whether committed by the villain skulking in the dark or by uniformed men stepping to the strains of martial music. Murder is murder, and somebody must answer. Somebody must explain the streams of blood that flowed in the Indian country in the summer of 1838. Somebody must explain the 4000 silent graves that mark the trail of the Cherokees to their exile. I wish I could forget it all, but the picture of 645 wagons lumbering over the frozen ground with their cargo of suffering humanity still lingers in my memory. Let the historian of a future day tell the sad story with its sighs, its tears and dying groans. Let the great Judge of all the earth weigh our actions and reward us according to our work. Children  Thus ends my promised birthday story. This December the 11th 1890.

A political philosophy that emerged in the early 20th century has challenged the idea that a person can be a true supporter of socialism from the comfort of their middle-class lives The term champagne socialist, often used pejoratively, refers to the perceived hypocrisy of liberal middle-class people who advocate for socialist ideals while continuing to enjoy their own affluent lifestyles. Since its conception more than a century ago, champagne socialism has been an enduring, if unofficial, part of politics in Britain and around the world. The pharse champagne socialist first appeared in the 1906 novel Blind Alleys by the American author George Cary Eggleston, in which one of the characters contrasts the so-called beer socialist  referencing the preferred beverage of the working class  to the champagne socialist in the middle class. This, Eggleston elucidates, is someone who wants everybody to be equal upon the higher plane that suits him, utterly ignoring the fact that there is not enough champagne, green turtle and truffles to go round. The novel sought to emphasise the gulf between the comfort of bourgeois life and the everyday hardships faced by the working class. The beer socialist is someone who wants everybody to come down to his low standards of living. Egglestone questioned the sincerity of those who, despite their privilege, champion economic and social equality. It could be expected that any accusations of hypocrisy when it comes to middle-class socialism would be coming chiefly from the political right. Yet some of the most vociferous attacks of champagne socialism have emanated from left-wing voices. A notable example is Ramsay MacDonald, the first Labour prime minister of the United Kingdom. He would be called a traitor to his partys egalitarian principles throughout his time in office, with critics lambasting his hobnobbing with the British elite. In 1931, with the economy reeling from the aftershocks of the Wall Street Crash two years earlier and the subsequent Great Depression, MacDonald formed the National Government. This was a coalition of the major political parties, but dominated by the Conservatives, so was immediately seen by many on the left as a betrayal of the organised labour movement. MacDonald was even expelled from his own party. More recently, supporters of New Labour  led by Tony Blair in the 1990s and 2000s  faced similar accusations. Critics of Blair, Gordon Brown and their allies pointed to their middle-class backgrounds, their courting of the Cool Britannia campaign a pop-culture-heavy celebration of all things British, and their perceived compromises on traditional Labour values, as the embodiment of champagne socialism. Variations of champagne socialism have existed in many nations around the world. In the 1980s, the term gauche caviar left caviar became particularly popular in France as an attack on their president François Mitterrand, for what his political enemies saw as his duplicity. In New Zealand and Australia, the preferred insult was for a time chardonnay socialist. But the implicit meaning of such insults has been expanded beyond socialism to expose hypocrisy among all progressive strains of thought. So in the United States, for example, one of the equivalent terms became limousine liberal. Other caricatures have emerged, from experts in their ivory towers to the luvvies of the metropolitan liberal elite. All have come to disparage a social caste regarded as being at the top of society who make vaguely egalitarian signals from their life of luxury inside gated communities, far removed from the experiences of ordinary people. Opponents of socialism have long relished pointing out that certain individuals on the left have enjoyed comfortable lives. Friedrich Engels  friend and sponsor of Karl Marx, and co-author of The Communist Manifesto  came from a wealthy family that owned factories, after all. Nevertheless, the label has occasionally been embraced by those on the left who reject the notion that socialism should aspire to a minimalist and austere existence. Returning to Blind Alleys, why should they give up the green turtle and truffles? Rather, they point out that their egalitarian beliefs stem from a desire to ensure that everybody is able to enjoy the finer things in life.
