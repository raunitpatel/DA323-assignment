Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has told staff he plans to make the grant program technology-neutral, the people said. That change will free up states to award more funds to satellite-internet providers such as Starlink, rather than mainly to companies that lay fiber-optic cables, to connect the millions of U.S. households that lack high-speed internet service.

Check out the Rocket Visa Signature Card to learn how you can earn rewards Read our review of Rocket Mortgage Whos this for? If you want the ease of homebuying from home, Rocket Mortgage isnt just an online lender Its the largest mortgage provider in the U.S. and continually tops JD Powers mortgage satisfaction surveys. Standout benefits Borrowers who meet income requirements can put as little as 1 down on a Rocket ONE loan without paying private mortgage insurance. Rocket also offers government-backed HomeReady and Home Possible loans, which only require a 3 down payment. If you are financing the purchase of your home with a loan, the down payment is the portion you pay up front. If you make a 20 down payment on a 500,000 house, for example, youll need financing for the remaining 80, or 400,000. The down payment shows a lender that you are financially invested in the property and unlikely to default on mortgage payments. Usually, it must be made with certified funds, like a certified check, cashiers check or wire transfer. In 2024, down payments for first-timers averaged 9, according to the National Association of Realtors, and thats the highest theyve been since 1997. If you put less than 20 down, however, youll probably need private mortgage insurance. Depending on the kind of home loan, there are minimum down payment requirements There are different strategies to saving up a down payment and most can be deployed in tandem. A high-yield savings account or money market account will grow your money faster and you can funnel a portion of your paycheck into it each month by setting up an automatic transfer. In addition, having it be a separate account will help you fight the urge to dip into your fund for other reasons. Consider how long you want to save for a home and devise a budget that lets you meet your goal in that timeframe. You may realize you need more time to pay down debts and improve your credit score to qualify for a better rate. Where can you trim expenses? It might mean eating out less, canceling streaming services or finding cheaper car insurance. If you rent, you may want to look for a cheaper place or even consider moving back home with your family. Another savings strategy is to commit to funneling any tax refunds, work bonuses, cash gifts or other extra money that comes your way into your down payment fund. The average federal refund in 2024 was 3,138. That can give your nest egg a considerable boost. There are several home loans guaranteed by the federal government. Guild Mortgage offers conventional and government-backed mortgages in all states except New York. The Homebuyer Express guarantee ensures closing in 17 days or borrowers receive 500 in closing costs not available in Oregon. While Guild received an A from the Better Business Bureau and scored highly on JD Powers 2023 mortgage originator survey, it was ranked near the bottom for mortgage servicing. Mortgage types Conventional, FHA, VA, USDA, jumbo Minimum credit score 600 for Zero Down, 620 for Arrive Home Minimum down payment 0 for an Arrive Home or Zero Down, 0 for VA or USDA loan, 1 for conventional loans  Return to summary  New American Funding is licensed to lend everywhere except Hawaii and New York and, unlike many lenders, displays sample rates online. While it ranked below average in JD Powers mortgage origination survey, NAF lands near the top for mortgage servicers and received an A from the Better Business Bureau.

Mortgage types Conventional, FHA, VA, jumbo, DreaMaker, Standard Agency loans Minimum credit score 620 for conventional loans, 580 for FHA Minimum down payment 3 for DreaMaker or Standard Agency loan, 0 for VA Return to summary  Navy Federal Credit Union is the largest credit union in the U.S., but membership is limited to active service members, veterans, Reservists, Defense Department staff and their families.

FHA loans, VA loans and USDA loans are all popular types of low-down-payment mortgages insured by government agencies, each with its own eligibility requirements. In addition, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac back HomeReady, Home Possible and HomeOne mortgages. Many banks have proprietary mortgages with low down payments With Rocket Mortgages Rocket ONE loan, for example, you can put as little as 1 down without private mortgage insurance. The median down payment for first-time homebuyers between July 2022 and June 2023 was 8, according to the National Association of Realtors.
