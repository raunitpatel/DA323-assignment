Read our PNC Bank mortgage review Whos this for? PNC is one of the few big banks that offers USDA loans, which are zero-down mortgages for properties in select rural and suburban regions.

Standout benefits PNCs speedy preapproval process can get you an answer within 30 minutes. Borrowers in eligible locations may qualify for a grant of up to 7,500 toward closing costs, down payment or other fees. If you are financing the purchase of your home with a loan, the down payment is the portion you pay up front. If you make a 20 down payment on a 500,000 house, for example, youll need financing for the remaining 80, or 400,000. The down payment shows a lender that you are financially invested in the property and unlikely to default on mortgage payments. Usually, it must be made with certified funds, like a certified check, cashiers check or wire transfer. In 2024, down payments for first-timers averaged 9, according to the National Association of Realtors, and thats the highest theyve been since 1997. If you put less than 20 down, however, youll probably need private mortgage insurance. VA loans and USDA loans can be approved with nothing down but some loans have minimum down payment requirements There are different strategies to saving up a down payment and most can be deployed in tandem. A high-yield savings account or money market account will grow your money faster and you can funnel a portion of your paycheck into it each month by setting up an automatic transfer. In addition, having it be a separate account will help you fight the urge to dip into your fund for other reasons. Consider how long you want to save for a home and devise a budget that lets you meet your goal in that timeframe. You may realize you need more time to pay down debts and improve your credit score to qualify for a better rate. Where can you trim expenses? It might mean eating out less, canceling streaming services or finding cheaper car insurance. If you rent, you may want to look for a cheaper place or even consider moving back home with your family. Another savings strategy is to commit to funneling any tax refunds, work bonuses, cash gifts or other extra money that comes your way into your down payment fund. The average federal refund in 2024 was 3,138. That can give your nest egg a considerable boost. There are several home loans guaranteed by the federal government. Rocket Mortgage offers verified approval in as little as two hours, with an average closing time of just 22 days.

Anything less than that is considered a low down payment. FHA loans, VA loans and USDA loans are all low-down-payment mortgages insured by government agencies. In addition, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac back HomeReady, Home Possible and HomeOne mortgages, which require less down. Many banks have proprietary mortgages with low down payments, too With Rocket Mortgages Rocket ONE loan, for example, you can put as little as 1 down without private mortgage insurance. The median down payment for first-time homebuyers between July 2022 and June 2023 was 8, according to the National Association of Realtors. Putting less than 20 down, however, will likely mean youll have to pay private mortgage insurance. Money matters  so make the most of it.

While CNBC Select earns a commission from affiliate partners on many offers and links, we create all our content without input from our commercial team or any outside third parties, and we pride ourselves on our journalistic standards and ethics. To determine which mortgage lenders are the best for low or no down payment, CNBC Select analyzed dozens of home loans offered by both online and brick-and-mortar banks. We focused on the following features Minimum down payment We favored lenders that offered specialty loans with lower down payment requirements or that offered government-backed FHA, VA and USDA loans. Credit score Most lenders require a 620 FICO score to secure a conventional mortgage. We noted if a lender had options for borrowers with poor credit. Closing times We gave more weight to lenders with shorter-than-average closing times or that guaranteed an on-time closing. Fees The mortgage process includes origination, application and underwriting fees, as well as charges for appraisals, title insurance, attorneys and other closing costs. When possible, we noted if a lender had lower fees, discounts or waived certain fees. Application process We considered whether lenders offered an online preapproval and application process and if there were physical branches for an in-person experience. Customer service We gave more weight to lenders that scored highly on J.D. Powers mortgage origination and servicing surveys. We also noted if they had robust customer service phone hours and a website with an online chat feature and educational resources. We also considered CNBC Select audience data when available, such as general demographics and engagement with our content and tools. Based on that criteria, our recommendations for the best mortgage lenders for a low down payment are Catch up on CNBC Selects in-depth coverage of credit cards, banking and money, and follow us on TikTok, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter to stay up to date.  2025 SELECT  All rights reserved.
