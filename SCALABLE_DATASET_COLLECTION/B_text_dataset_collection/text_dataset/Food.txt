Say goodbye to dry, bland banana bread. For a showstopping loaf with a deep golden crust and velvety crumb, use your microwave. YIELD 10 Makes one 9-inch loaf TIME 2½ hours Be sure to use very ripe, heavily speckled or even black bananas in this recipe. This recipe can be made using 5 thawed frozen bananas since they release a lot of liquid naturally, they can bypass the microwaving in step 2 and go directly into the fine-mesh strainer. Do not use a thawed frozen banana in step 4 it will be too soft to slice. Instead, simply sprinkle the top of the loaf with sugar. The test kitchens preferred loaf pan measures 8½ by 4½ inches if you use a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan, start checking for doneness five minutes earlier than advised in the recipe. The texture is best when the loaf is eaten fresh, but it can be stored cool completely first, covered tightly with plastic wrap, for up to 3 days. 1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat oven to 350 degrees. Spray 8½ by 4½-inch loaf pan with nonstick cooking spray. Whisk flour, baking soda, and salt together in large bowl. 2. Place 5 bananas in microwave-safe bowl cover with plastic wrap and cut several steam vents in plastic with paring knife. Microwave on high power until bananas are soft and have released liquid, about 5 minutes. Transfer bananas to fine-mesh strainer placed over medium bowl and allow to drain, stirring occasionally, 15 minutes you should have ½ to ¾ cup liquid. 3. Transfer liquid to medium saucepan and cook over medium-high heat until reduced to ¼ cup, about 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat, stir reduced liquid into bananas, and mash with potato masher until fairly smooth. Whisk in butter, eggs, brown sugar, and vanilla. 4. Pour banana mixture into flour mixture and stir until just combined with some streaks of flour remaining. Gently fold in walnuts, if using. Scrape batter into prepared pan. Slice remaining banana diagonally into ¼-inch-thick slices. Shingle banana slices on top of either side of loaf, leaving 1½-inch-wide space down center to ensure even rise. Sprinkle granulated sugar evenly over loaf. 5. Bake until toothpick inserted in center of loaf comes out clean, 55 to 75 minutes. Cool bread in pan on wire rack 15 minutes, then remove loaf from pan and continue to cool on wire rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.

Canned chickpeas and beans are usually a bit too firm for some preparations, like dips and braises this rapid-tenderization method is the perfect fix. Serious Eats  Amanda Suarez Canned beans are high on my list of useful food innovations. You dont need to remember to soak dried beans overnight or spend a long time cooking them on a busy weekdayjust pop the top and theyre ready to go. Regardless of the typewhether soft like northern white beans or firm like kidney beanscanned beans are almost always perfectly cooked and work well in many recipes. For example, you can drain and then dry them in the oven for black bean burger patties. You can marinate them in vinaigrettes and flavorings to quickly create bean salads. And you can process them into dips and spreads. However, some recipes require really soft beanssofter than what comes out of the can. Try making hummus from canned chickpeas and youll likely end up with something tasty but slightly grainy, not with the silky smoothness of the best hummus. Similarly, mashing canned pinto beans wont give you the velvety, creamy texture of great frijoles refritos. Many chickpea braises and stews are also at their best only when the chickpea are so tender that they collapse with the slightest pressure. For a good chana masala, for instance, the chickpeas should be soft enough to squish easily between the folds of warm, spongy naan. Serious Eats  Amanda Suarez When making chickpeas from scratch, Indians often use pressure cookers to achieve the desired softness in a reasonable amount of time. But what if you want to take advantage of the convenience of canned chickpeas? Theyre cooked, but resist being smushed when pressed, which means you need to do something to them. Luckily, the solutionbriefly simmering the canned chickpeas or other beans with baking sodais quick enough to still offer the convenience of canned, while yielding legumes that are properly softened. Just about any canned chickpea would benefit with extra softening when destined for recipes like purées and braises where an extra-soft texture is desired, but some require an intervention more than others. Thats because not all canned beans are prepared the same and some are processed to hold their shape too well. Canned bean manufacturers aim to sell beans with minimal splits and blowouts, as splits in beans look unattractive and cause starch to leak out. To ensure sufficient firmness, they often add calcium chloride during processing. You can check the cans ingredients list to see if it was used in your can of beans or not. I checked five brands of canned beans and found that those with calcium chloride had much firmer beans with a higher resistance to chewing. While the texture of each brand varied slightly, there was a noticeable increase in hardness when calcium chloride was used. Calcium chloride prevents beans from getting mushy by reacting with the pectin in the beans. When heated, the pectin in the chickpea cell walls absorbs water and expands, forming cross-links with the dissolved calcium ions. This creates a stable, heat-resistant network, making the seed coats firmer, preventing them from breaking open. There are some ways to deal with the extra firmness caused by calcium chloride, but before that, let us talk about the canning liquid. As mentioned above, any canned bean can benefit from a softening step if its going into a dish where extremely silky purées or tender braises are the goal, but its particularly important when using canned beans that have been treated with calcium chloride. One of the best ways to rapidly soften canned beans lies in the properties of baking soda. The baking soda replaces stiff calcium ions in the beans with more flexible sodium ions and creates an alkaline environment that breaks down the glycosidic bonds holding the beans pectin molecules together, resulting in the desired softness. Serious Eats  Amanda Suarez You dont need much, just a half teaspoon of baking soda for every 1 12 cups of beans this is the typical yield of a 15-ounce can. The longer you boil the beans with baking soda, the more it breaks them down. After five minutes, the beans have begun to absorb the baking soda. Around seven minutes, you get a soft, swollen bean, with skins that are softened in a wonderful way, providing a seamless texture when you bite into them. Beyond seven or eight minutes and the skins begin to separate as the insides start to soften and then collapse. By the 20-minute mark, the baking soda begins to disintegrate the bean structure, with many bits sticking to the surface of the saucepan. Serious Eats  Swetha Sivakumar The downside of this baking soda technique is that the boiling liquid tastes a bit soapy and bitter, and this taste can transfer to any dish in which the cooking liquid is used. I therefore recommend draining the canned beans first, saving the canning liquid, and simmering the beans with baking soda and plain water. You can then drain and discard the baking soda liquid and return the beans to their caning liquid along with any additional liquid needed for your recipe. In practice, the best way to do this is One final note Baking soda can change the beans color, making it darker due to its effect on the anthocyanins in colored beans like pinto and kidney beans. An alternative to baking soda is to use a pressure cooker to further tenderize canned beans. Simply empty the can into the cooker and set itno stirring or babysitting required. Its important to note, however, that there isnt the same time savings here The pressure cooker takes about ten minutes to build pressure, five minutes to soften the beans, and ten minutes beyond that for the pressure to decrease. Thats almost a half-hour of cooking time added to your recipe, and not all that much shorter than cooking dried beans from scratch in a pressure cooker. That said, you can take advantage of the pressure cooker by adding aromatics to the bean liquid, improving their flavor. Even with just five minutes of pressure cooking and a few spices like a bay leaf, cinnamon stick, cloves, and cardamom tossed in, the canned bean liquid and beans become wonderfully aromatic. You may be wondering if theres an argument for combining the powers of baking soda and a pressure cooker for softening canned beans. I tested it and concluded that its generally not a good idea. The results were very squishy beans that quickly disintegrate into a sludge. There may be some instances, like bean purées, where this extreme softness wouldnt be a huge problem, but mostly I think its best to choose one method or the other, not both.

Juicy fried pork chops braised in soy sauce, rice wine, and sesame oil are a staple of Taiwans railway bento boxes. Serious Eats  Deli Studios In Taiwan, where I live, one of the most beloved and novel features of our train system is the railway bento box. Known in Mandarin Chinese as biàn dang 便當, these boxed meals are sold exclusively at train stations or on the train itself, offering sustenance for tens of thousands of travelers daily. The lunch sets were originally inspired by Japanese bentos and first appeared in Taiwan during its Japanese colonial era in the early 20th century, when enterprising vendors sold them packed inside thin wooden boxes off of the train platforms. They became such a hit that in 1949, the Taiwan Railway Administration took matters into its own hands and started producing its own packaged meals. Serious Eats  Amanda Suarez Today, every morning at 6 a.m., about 28,000 bento boxes are prepared at six central kitchens, an impressive choreography that moves approximately 10 million bentos each year. Official vendors branded with a dark blue Taiwan Railway logo sell the bentos at the stations, and on the trains, cart-pushing attendants hand out the boxes to hungry travelers. Selling for a bit less than 3.50 USD, each bento is a neatly packaged meal filled with an assortment of rice, vegetables, and a choice of protein. When my parents were young, railway bentos were served in round stainless steel boxes, which could be dropped off for reuse afterward. The railway would clean and reuse the boxes, though the metal boxes were eventually phased out for plastic because people kept forgetting to return them. Today, these train meals remain a nostalgic symbol of the Japanese era, and are still a regular part of modern society. Serious Eats  Deli Studios The composition of a railway bento meal is straightforward yet well-balanced. At its core is a generous serving of white short-grain rice sticky, absorbent, and perfect for soaking up sauces. Alongside the rice, youll find a side of vegetables, typically steamed or lightly sautéed with minced garlic and a pinch of salt. There might be a braised egg or tofu as well, for heft. The centerpiece, however, is always the proteinsometimes chicken, fish, or tofu, but most often, it is a tender slab of fried and braised pork chop. Pork is a go-to protein for these boxes because its cheap and popular in Taiwan at these central kitchens, roughly 15,000 pork chops are made each day. Taiwanese bentos are well balanced in that there arent copious amounts of just one ingredient. Having a massive slab of pork would throw off the ratio, and youd need a fork and a knife to eat it, which isnt the best set-up when youre sitting on a moving train or quickly wolfing down lunch while waiting on the platform. Bento box pork chops have to be thin and light enough to pick up with chopsticks. The key is getting a small three to four-ounce slab of boneless pork loin and pounding it thinly with a meat tenderizer or the back of your knife until its about half-inch thick. I tried making this recipe with a thicker slab it was clunky and difficult to eat, and I wouldnt recommend it. Serious Eats  Deli Studios Because its a lunchbox staple thats meant to travel, one of the most important elements of this dish is its durability. Accomplishing that is a multi-step process First, you marinate the pork, then coat it with starch, fry it, and finally, braise it. It might seem counterintuitive to braise something deep-fried, but because frying creates air pockets in the coating, there are plenty of nooks and crannies in the crisp coating for the sauce to cling onto. A similar technique is used for dishes like General Tsos chicken and orange chicken, where the crisp, breaded exterior helps the sauce adhere better. But here, the exterior isnt so much crispy as it is spongy. When the pork is braised, the crispy exterior transforms into a tender surface that holds up well after hours of travel and still tastes good even when its at room temperature. Admittedly, braised pork chops are often overcooked in Taiwan, so I recommend only deep-frying for about two minutes before finishing it off in the braising liquid. Most vendors deep-fry all the meat ahead of time, let it rest for an hour, and just plop it into the simmering braising liquid when its time to serve. This way, the meat is served hot. Usually, when Im putting together a braising liquid for plain tofu and eggs, soy sauce makes up around 20 of the liquid. However, because the pork chop is already saturated with flavors from the marinade of soy sauce, rice wine, sugar, sesame oil, and white pepper, I dial down the soy sauce level to about 13. This adjustment helps maintain a balanced flavor thats savory without being overwhelming. The braising liquid is only for the breading, so the pork only really has to bathe in there for five to eight minutes for the coating to soak up the flavor. My recipe includes tangerine peel and Sichuan peppercorns as optional ingredientswhile the pork chops are delicious without the spices, I find that they add a comforting warmth and depth. Serious Eats  Deli Studios While the train bento may hail from Japan, it differs from Japanese-style bentos in several ways. Mostly, the ingredients in Japanese bentos are typically separated into individual compartments. Taiwanese bentos are layered The rice, protein, and vegetables are on top of or directly next to one another. The flavors are also distinctly Taiwanese proteins are almost always braised in soy sauce accented with sugar and star anise. Braised foods are a staple on the islandthe cooking method is a cheap and efficient way to infuse flavor into meat, eggs, and tofu. Serious Eats  Deli Studios That said, there are also similarities between the two styles. Both maintain a balanced ratio of rice, greens, and protein. Most significantly, the rice is always a short-grain white rice, a variety introduced to Taiwan by Japanese colonists who spent a decade cultivating it. Its sticky, absorbent nature makes it perfect for soaking up the bold flavors of the braised pork and tender vegetables, be it eggplant, cabbage, or simple stir-fried greens. Even if a trip to Taiwan isnt in the cards, this recipe offers a taste of its unique railway culture. And its a dish that travels well, as proven by the tens of thousands of commuters who enjoy it every day.

Serious Eats  Deli Studios Place one pork chop on a clean cutting board and, using the ridged side of a meat mallet or blunt side of a Chinese cleaver, pound pork chops gently to 12-inch thickness. Set aside and repeat with remaining pork chops. Serious Eats  Deli Studios Add pork chops to the soy sauce mixture, massaging and tossing the pork to evenly coat with marinade. Cover tightly with plastic wrap or a lid and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 8 hours. Serious Eats  Deli Studios When ready to cook, set a wire rack inside a rimmed baking sheet and line rack with a double layer of paper towels set aside. Heat oil in a wok or medium-size Dutch oven over medium-high heat until oil reaches 350F 175C on an instant-read or fryer thermometer. Serious Eats  Deli Studios In a wide, shallow dish, add sweet potato starch. Working with 1 pork chop at a time, dredge both sides in sweet potato starch, pressing gently to adhere. Gently shake off excess sweet potato starch and transfer to a large plate. Repeat with remaining chops. Serious Eats  Deli Studios Using tongs, add 2 pork chops to hot oil, gently sliding them in as close to the oils surface as possible to minimize splashing. Cook until pork is light golden brown, about 2 minutes, adjusting heat as needed to maintain an oil temperature of 350F 175C. Using tongs, transfer pork to prepared baking sheet. Using a skimmer or ladle, remove any leftover crumbs from oil. Repeat with the remaining pork chops. Serious Eats  Deli Studios In a medium pot, combine water, soy sauce, rice wine, sugar, ginger, garlic, scallions, star anise, tangerine or mandarin peel if using, and Sichuan peppercorns if using. Bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to low and allow liquid to slow to a gentle simmer. Using tongs, carefully add 2 deep-fried pork chops, handling gently to ensure breading does not fall off. Cover and simmer until the pork chop is fully cooked and registers 145F 63C on an instant thermometer, 4 to 8 minutes. Gently remove chop and set aside. Repeat with the remaining pork chops. Serve with cooked white rice. Serious Eats  Deli Studios Meat mallet or Chinese cleaver, wire rack, rimmed baking sheet, wok or Dutch oven, instant-read thermometer, tongs Thick sweet potato starch can be purchased at most Chinese supermarkets. It is coarser than the finely ground kind, helping to create the right kind of crunchy coating on this pork look for brands that specify between thick and thin sweet potato starch on the label to make sure you have the right type. If you can only find thin, you can use a spray bottle or your hands to lightly dampen the starch, then toss it with your hands so that it clumps up and creates small beads. Once cooled, the pork chops can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. The chops can be eaten cold, at room temperature, or warm. If you would like to serve them warm, reheat in the microwave until warmed through.
