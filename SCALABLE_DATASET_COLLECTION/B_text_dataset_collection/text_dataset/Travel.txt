From ice skating and Christmas markets to fabulous hotels, there are many reasons to visit Paris in the winter. Heres a guide to the seasons best offerings. Theres no such thing as a bad time to visit Paris. The city retains its romantic charm all year long, with winter offering its own unique appeal trees and Haussmannian boulevards gleam with twinkle lights, cafes glow with red heat lamps, and department stores go all out with lavish holiday displays. While the gray gloom gets old after a while the French have a special word for it grisâtre, it can provide the perfect wintry backdrop for a shorter séjour. Whether youre looking for festive activities to fill up your holiday itinerary or wondering what to pack or where to stay, heres everything to know about how to make the most of your winter trip to Paris. Between December and February, temperatures in Paris tend to hover between the mid-30s and the upper 40s Fahrenheit. Dazzlingly sunny winter days arent uncommon, but for the most part, you should prepare yourself for a grayish drizzle made significantly more tolerable by easy access to spirit-lifting chocolat chaud or carafes of red wine. While theres a small chance youll luck out with a white Christmas, it rarely snows in Paris, and its typically only a dusting when it does. Deciding what to take on a trip to Paris is always a challenge, given the citys legendary fashion and its extensive but exhausting walkability. For a winter visit, pack clothing and accessories that can help you traverse the streets even in less-than-perfect weather. Itll serve you well to bring waterproof shoes or rain boots, and youll certainly want an umbrella. Invest in a chic and sturdy winter coat to complete your outfits, and pack plenty of layers to be ready for any temperature. If there are any particular restaurants on your must-try list, be sure that theyll be open during your visit. Many restaurants take a winter break during the week between Christmas and New Years Day, and plenty of establishments that dont take longer breaks will be closed on the actual holidays. Also, keep in mind that, throughout the year, many restaurants and shops close on Sundays and Mondays, while museums are often closed on Mondays and Tuesdays. From ice skating in the Marais to window shopping at festively decorated department stores, there are a range of winter-specific activities to enjoy in Paris. Rent a pair of skates and glide around against the backdrop of one of Pariss most beautiful buildings the Hôtel de Ville City Hall, in the heart of the Marais neighborhood. Each winter, the historic landmark transforms its courtyard into a public ice skating rink, which is open daily during the season. As a bonus, its a stones throw from the BHV, a department store that gussies up its windows every December in true festive fashion. From late November until early January, a panoply of chestnut-scented Christmas markets spring up around the city. Vendors in Swiss-style wooden chalets serve up every soul-warming thing you can think of  hot mulled wine and cider, wheels of raclette, and more. The most famous  and certainly most sprawling  is by the Tuileries Garden, where the market has expanded into something of an annual carnival. Other beloved markets theres one in nearly every neighborhood can be found next to Notre Dame and in Montmartre at Place des Abbesses. At beloved department stores like Galeries Lafayette, Printemps Haussmann, and Le Bon Marché, the holiday season comes with a host of visual and sartorial delights. Extravagantly festive window displays are the initial draw, with panoramas that range from smiling Santas and cancan-dancing gingerbread men to full-blown mini winter villages. Step inside the stores, though, and youll be dazzled by the stories-high Christmas trees glittering overhead and twinkle lights decking the halls. Les soldes the sales take place twice a year in Paris and are a shoppers dream, with prices slashed on everything from designer clothes to home goods. The winter sales run from January to February, with markdowns majorly increasing as the weeks go by. If the weather gets too gloomy for a stroll along the Seine, theres no shortage of excellent museums and exhibits to pop into all around the city. Whether youre a fashion fanatic, impressionist lover, or history buff, theres something for every sort of traveler. Just note that its always best to book tickets in advance. Eye-catching exhibitions this winter include the Pop Forever Tom Wesselmann at the Louis Vuitton Foundation, a Harriet Backer exhibit at the Musée dOrsay, and Figures of the Fool at the Louvre. The abundance of pastries in Paris can add a sweet note to your visit at any time of year. A winter-specific highlight, though, is bûche de Noël, a traditional Christmas dessert thats essentially a rolled-up sponge cake  but with endless variations and extravagant formations. Youll find the cakes all over Paris during the holidays, but some of the best come from the Ritz Paris, Hôtel Lutetia, and Pierre Hermé. Whether youre looking to splurge on the ultimate luxury experience or keep things more budget-friendly, theres a wide range of hotels to choose from. For higher-end options, there are few places more synonymous with classic French luxury than the Ritz Paris in the 1st arrondissement neighborhood.

Accessible travel blog founder Cory Lee is committed to helping other wheelchair users travel the world freely. Courtesy of Cory Lee For Travel  Leisures column Traveling As, were talking to travelers about what its like to explore the world through their unique perspectives. We chatted with accessible travel advocate Cory Lee, who runs Curb Free With Cory Lee, about his passion for travel  and how hes helping fellow wheelchair users experience the world. Heres his story At the age of 2, I was diagnosed with spinal muscular atrophy, a form of muscular dystrophy. It basically means I have overall muscle weakness. By 4 years old, I was not able to walk at all and had to use a power wheelchair full-time. The first trip I remember going on was to Walt Disney World with my family when I had just become a wheelchair user. It was a really fun trip. Im still kind of a Disney addict because the parks are so accessible, and Im able to stay in my wheelchair on a lot of the rides, which is amazing. At 15, I traveled internationally for the first time to the Bahamas, trying new foods and experiencing a different culture. Thats when the travel bug really bit me. Courtesy of Cory Lee Growing up in the southeastern U.S, we would go on road trips, but once I started going further, it showed me you really have to get out there to understand cultures and the ways of life for different people. Ive found that people everywhere are friendly and helpful, and theres so much empathy. But there were  and still are  many challenges traveling in a wheelchair. It seems like at least one thing will go wrong on every trip. Some of the initial challenges were around navigation, like finding accessible taxis and public transportation. Courtesy of Cory Lee The first time I went to New York City, I got trapped underground in the subway for four hours while trying to get to a Broadway show. The elevators werent working at multiple accessible stops, so we rode to the next one and it was the same. At one point, we even talked to some policemen about possibly carrying me up the stairs. But my wheelchair weighs about 400 pounds, so it was nearly impossible. Eventually, we found an elevator that was out of the way. Once on the street level, we got a taxi, but I almost missed the show. I havent been back in the subway since then, and I only use taxis when in New York now. Then, on my first trip to Europe, we plugged my wheelchair charger into the wall with a converter in Munich. Sparks flew and it blew up the charger. Fortunately, we found a repair shop the next day. Things like that in the beginning were a struggle, but they prepared me. Now, I try to stay positive and have a good attitude, knowing itll work itself out in the end. Courtesy of Cory Lee When I was about to graduate from college with a degree in marketing, I was sending out job applications and not getting many responses. One day, a company in Pittsburgh called and said if I could get myself there the next day, they would interview me for the job. So, I flew from Atlanta to Pittsburgh the next day, and as soon as I rolled into the hiring managers office, he looked me up and down and said, Well, this job involves traveling, so youre definitely not the best fit because you use a wheelchair. He shut me down, even though I traveled to get there. That same week, I was planning my college graduation trip to Australia. I noticed there was so little information about accessible travel. Between those two things, I decided to start a blog, Curb Free With Cory Lee in December 2013. It was a different world at the time. There were many destinations I couldnt have visited 10 or even five years ago. It seems like every week theres a new tour company that focuses on accessible travel or a transportation option that opens. Im grateful the world is realizing the need for accessibility and there are many more possibilities for me now. For instance, Id wanted to visit India ever since I saw a picture of the Taj Mahal when I was a little kid. Unfortunately, there were zero accessible transportation options in the entire country until 2018, when Enable Travel started there. As soon as I learned about them, I immediately booked a trip. It was incredible, and the tour company did a phenomenal job with an adapted vehicle that took us to all the accessible sites. And I finally was able to see the Taj Mahal. Courtesy of Cory Lee There have been so many pioneers and disability advocates that fought so long to make the world more accessible. I was born in 1990  the year the Americans with Disabilities Act was passed. My generation is now fighting for inclusion in all aspects of life, and its the whole community of people with disabilities that has made this possible. Here in the U.S., in recent years, many state parks are getting all-terrain wheelchairs that you can borrow on a complimentary basis, opening up the outdoors and trails to wheelchair users for the first time. Ive seen them in Tennessee, Michigan, and Minnesota, so Im able to now explore the outdoors. Ive also noticed a huge change on the beaches in the U.S. within the past few years. Many now have mobility mats, so Im able to roll out on the sand and stay in my wheelchair. They also have beach wheelchairs to go in the water or out on the sand further. I would have loved to see all of this much earlier, but its exciting its finally being done. And it feels like a huge shift within the travel industry, so Im happy the next generation of wheelchair users will have a more accessible world than I did growing up. When I was little, if I went to the beach, my mom had to physically pick me up out of my wheelchair and carry me down to the sand  that was not an easy process at all. The fact that kids who use a wheelchair nowadays can visit the beach like any other person is incredible. Courtesy of Cory Lee As for flying, booking a flight is a fairly simple process. Im pretty loyal to Delta Air Lines because Im based near Atlanta. Im able to input the dimensions of my wheelchair and its weight. Then, I call them in advance of the flight to make sure they have the information they need and are prepared for me to arrive. Its a bit of a process. and I would love for flying overall to be easier for people who use a wheelchair, but its slowly getting there. Im able to stay in my wheelchair until I get to the door of the plane. There, I have to transfer into another narrow wheelchair from the airline that squeezes down the aisle of the plane. They then have to physically pick me up and put me in the seat. The airlines do provide assistance for transferring me into the plane seat. Hopefully, well see a shift and be able to stay in our wheelchairs during the flight. In 2018, I started hosting Curb Free group trips where my followers could join me in different destinations around the world. I look forward to traveling with other wheelchair users because we learn so much from each other during these trips. Our first trip was to Morocco, a destination you may not think is wheelchair accessible. But there we were, four wheelchair users rolling through an alleyway in Marrakech. We got a lot of stares and questions. I believe were really changing perspectives when people see us out in the world on these international trips. When I was in India, many people were taking photos of me as they had never seen a powered wheelchair before. Im completely OK with that because I hope they learn more about people with disabilities. Hopefully, it gave them a new perspective that I was able to get out there in the world and explore despite using this mobility device. That said, I kept hearing from my audience that the trips I was going on looked incredible, but there are so many financial barriers for people with disabilities. So, in 2022, I started The Curb Free Foundation, a nonprofit organization that provides travel grants to wheelchair users for their dream trips. I wanted to be able to open up the world to those who could otherwise not afford to have these experiences traveling. So far, we have sent people to Disney World, the Caribbean, and soon Morocco. A few months ago, we even sent an 80-year-old wheelchair user to the beach for the first time in his life. He had just been admitted to a nursing home, but got permission to leave for a week to visit Tybee Island. Weve provided some incredible experiences through the foundation and its my favorite thing Ive ever done. Courtesy of Cory Lee As a wheelchair user, I can stay at home and be comfortable for the rest of my life. But when you get out there in the world, maybe things dont go as theyre supposed to, but youre gaining so much insight. Travel teaches empathy. I always have to travel with a companion because I do need assistance throughout the flight or going to the restroom or transferring into bed at night or showering. But I love that feeling of being pushed out of my comfort zone and being able to experience something new. The general public of able-bodied people need to see wheelchair users living these amazing lives and traveling around the world, and it will really change perspectives.

These resorts keep the lifts spinning late into the season, providing access to some of the best springand summerskiing in North America. It is typical to crave a tropical destination when trying to survive the last few months of winter, but skiers know that springtime is the best-kept secret in the sport. With fewer crowds, soft snow, and long après-ski afternoons spent in the sunshine, this is the best time of year to be on the mountain. The intensity of chasing mid-winter powder days has subsided, and the celebratory spring atmosphere brings a new energy. Pack your sunscreen and warm-weather wax and get ready to enjoy the last few turns of the season. From longtime skiers to families looking for a relaxing mountain trip during a less conventional time of year, here are some of the best late-season ski destinations in America. Want to learn how to ski? Let an Olympian teach you. If you are planning a spring ski trip on the West Coast, Mammoth Mountain is where you want to be. With a summit at 11,053 feet above sea level, this resort holds onto snow. Mammoths notorious windstorms stack up deep base totals all winter, meaning the resort regularly stays open past Memorial Day, and it has stretched into August in record years. With more than 300 days of sunshine, spring skiing here is as good as a beach day. From the famous Unbound Terrain Parks, which stay open through closing day, to Elevation Mammoth and ski camp for people over the age of 50, Mammoth has something for everyone. Timberline Lodge, high on Oregons Mt. Hood, is known far and wide for having the longest ski season in North America. Averaging approximately 600 inches of snowfall annually, the season stretches far into the summer. Timberlines freestyle scene draws skiers and snowboarders from across the country to ride its spring and summer terrain parks. Olympic athletes, professional racers, and dedicated snow lovers travel here all summer for a second season. But its not just for the professionals  long cruising runs, soft spring snow, and unpredictable Pacific Northwest weather make every day here fun and exciting for visitors. Alyeska Resort is the only ski area in North America where you can see snowcapped mountains, glaciers, and ocean views all in one place. Tucked into the Chugach Mountains of south-central Alaska, this place is worth the trip for scenery alone, but the spring conditions can be just as impressive. Some years bring fresh powder in April, while others provide perfect corn snow  those large, springtime granules shaped by the daily melt-freeze cycle  softening under 15 hours of daylight. You can ski until 8 p.m. through mid-March, and make the most of the long Alaskan spring before closing day in late April. Arapahoe Basin, or A-Basin as its known, is where winter refuses to quit. At 13,050 feet, its one of the highest ski resorts in North America, which means it stays snowy long after most Colorado mountain runs shut down. It has one of the longest seasons in the country, often stretching into June and sometimes even until July 4. Lose some layers, pull out the tailgate grill, and head to The Beach  an iconic ski-in, ski-out parking lot at the base that transforms into a spring party extravaganza. Higher up, Lake Reveal, a naturally occurring pond skim, thaws in May, daring skiers to skim across  or sink trying. If youre looking for a resort with a true ski until you physically cant anymore mentality, A-Basin is it. Only for the expert riders, Mount Bohemia is something completely unique. There are no groomed runs and no beginner territory at this Midwestern resort, just pure, untamed backcountry-style riding. The resort was built with tree runs as its priority, and cleared trails were secondary. Two lifts access more than 600 acres of rugged terrain. At the heart of the resort sits a Nordic spa that stays open until midnight, complete with hot tubs, pools, saunas, steam baths, salt pods and cold plunges. Spring skiing on the East Coast can be hit or miss, but Sugarloaf is an exception. While most resorts pile their remaining snow onto one run to stay open, Sugarloaf keeps around 70 percent of its terrain open well into April, mostly ungroomed and sprawling with moguls. Its the only resort on the East Coast with above-tree line skiing, and its snowfields and backside terrain hold onto soft spring corn longer than elsewhere in the area. Lifts typically go into early May, and in April people travel from far and wide for Reggae Fest, one of the biggest spring skiing parties in the country. Some of the very best spring skiing in Utah is at Snowbird. The season stays open well into May, and in some years, even beyond. By springtime, the mountain is filled in, giving skiers access to miles of terrain without any of the mid-winter frenzy. May storms bringing inches of fresh snow are not uncommon.

Its 100 years since the civil rights activist was born. Follow in his footsteps on a tour of Bostons suburbs, where his legacy lives on. Malcolm Xs birthday will be recognised as a new annual holiday in Boston this May. Though born in Nebraska in 1925, the civil rights activist lived in the Massachusetts city on and off for 12 years during a pivotal  if controversial  era in the fight for African American rights in the US. The formative years he spent in Boston  becoming a leading Muslim minister here before his assassination at a New York rally in 1965  have left a lasting legacy that can still be seen in the citys monuments and thriving Black neighbourhoods. Bostons Black history starts long before Malcolm X, though. The Massachusetts capital was one of New Englands key slave ports in the 17th century and the state later became one of the first to abolish slavery. While the citys 2.5-mile Freedom Trail charts the national institutes that were pivotal in the countrys fight for independence, the 1.6-mile Black Heritage Trail focuses on Beacon Hill, a historic neighbourhood that was home to the citys largest community of African Americans prior to the Civil War. Today, its a pretty suburb of narrow, gas lamp-lit cobbled streets and the location of the Museum of African American History  a good starting point to understand what came before Malcolm X. The museums collection spans the colonial era to the 19th century and includes stories and artefacts from Black communities. Fittingly, its housed within the red brick walls of the African Meeting House, built in 1806 as the African Baptist Church of Boston and now considered the nations oldest still-existing Black church building. Plans are underway to extend the Black Heritage Trail to the neighbourhood of Roxbury, where Malcolm X lived during his time in Boston. In his 1965 book, The Autobiography of Malcolm X, released posthumously, he said that living in Roxbury gave him a great sense of being a part of a mass of his own kind for the first time. Today, its the epicentre of the citys African American community. Take a neighbourhood tour with passionate guides from Live Like a Local Tours Boston to discover spots such as Frugal Bookstore, a Black-owned business and community hub, and Tropical Foods, a longstanding, family-owned Afro-Caribbean and Latin American supermarket. At the latter, pick up snacks such as fresh pies and spicy beef patties. As part of the planned updates to the Black Heritage Trail, Roxburys Malcolm X Boulevard is set to be extended further into Dudley Street, a major thoroughfare beside Nubian Square  a block thats long been considered the heart of Black Boston thanks to its historical connections to social activism and African American culture. In Nubian Square, check out the Faces of Dudley mural, which features prominent local Black figures including Malcolm X, community and civil rights activist Melnea Cass and fellow campaigner Martin Luther King Jr, who met his wife Coretta Scott King a mile north of here, at the New England Conservatory of Music. Black-owned businesses thrive in the area surrounding the square make a pitstop at Nubian Markets cafe-restaurant for classic dishes like chickpea peanut stew and jerk chicken with fragrant coconut rice  a homage to Roxburys African diaspora. MLK and Malcolm X only met once. Heres the story behind an iconic image. Theres other interesting street art to check out in the neighbourhood, too. The Roxbury Love Story mural sits at the intersection of Shawmut Avenue and Melnea Cass Boulevard, on the site of the former Twelfth Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King Jr was once assistant minister. The artwork depicts Martin Luther King Jr and Coretta Scott across two walls of a residence building, with a telephone line connecting them. A plaque highlights the significance of the site and details prominent locations pertaining to the Kings. Roxbury has had other famous residents over the years head down Washington Street and youll find a mural of Roxbury-born disco queen Donna Summer. The singer-songwriter has been immortalised on the side of Black Market Nubian, a community-led enterprise hub that aims to strengthen Nubian Squares Black-majority community through art projects. No visit to Roxbury would be complete without walking by the Malcolm XElla Little-Collins House on Dale Street, where Malcolm X lived with his half-sister, Ella Little-Collins, from 1941 to 1944. The modest house was listed on the US National Register of Historic Places in 2021 and is the only surviving residence from Malcolms time in Boston. Its currently under restoration, with plans to offer tours for the first time. Before leaving Roxbury, take a stroll through Malcolm Xs greatest Boston legacy project Malcolm X Park, formerly Washington Park, which recently underwent a 9.6m 7.5m renovation. Local artists were commissioned to paint three new murals on the outdoor basketball courts, and an outdoor swimming pool remains free for all  perfect for a dip on hot days.

From local tribes worshipping a water goddess to Romans settling in areas with natural springs, Englands history of spa towns stretches further back than vacationing Victorians seeking to cure their ailments. Heres how to explore some of the countrys most historic spa towns and experience the natural spring waters yourself. Next time you swig some British spring water, take a moment to ponder where it came from  maybe Harrogate, Malvern or Buxton? From the late 1700s, English towns with nearby springs were transformed into spa destinations, becoming magnets for those who believed these waters could cure everything from scabies to smallpox. Today, these places, many of which are surrounded by granite hills and filled with reminders of the spa booms that shaped them, are fantastic destinations in their own right. Here are seven historic English spa towns that should be on your radar. The Romans settled the area around whats now known as Buxton in about 70 CE, drawn by the natural warm springs there. They subsequently built a temple dedicated to the goddess Arnemetia on the site, along with some spring-fed baths. Equally fond of steamy soaks was the fifth Duke of Devonshire  in 1780, he built the citys Georgian crescent and filled it with spa hotels. The buildings now house swanky Buxton Crescent hotel, where you can bathe in the mineral-rich waters that attracted the Romans all those years ago. Other highlights of this Peak District town thats home to Englands highest market include Buxtons Grade II-listed Pump Room now home to Buxton Visitor Centre and St Anns Well, which has quenched locals thirst for centuries. When Harrogates sulphuric waters were discovered in 1571, visitors from across England flocked there, initially gathering in marshy areas where the water flowed to the surface. By the 1700s, wellheads and ornate bath houses had been built, and the towns grandest structure was the Royal Pump Room now a museum, where wealthy visitors sipped Harrogates healing waters beneath an ornate octagonal roof hard-up locals could drink for free from a communal tap outside. Today, the Turkish Baths, in the former Royal Baths complex that first opened in 1897, is a great spot for a soak. Highlights there include the original terrazzo flooring and todays treatments are significantly more appealing than those from the 1800s. Peat bath, anyone? Former fans of this towns spring water, filtered through the Malvern Hills hard rocks, include Florence Nightingale and Charles Darwin. During Victorian times, thousands flocked here for the so-called water cure pioneered by Dr James Wilson. The treatment involved stripping naked, being wrapped in spring water-soaked sheets and laying in a cold bath. Today, the town is surrounded by numerous springs, one of which feeds St Anns Well, a shell-shaped fountain where you can fill your flask before hiking to the summit of nearby Worcestershire Beacon, 1,394ft above sea level. You can learn more about Malverns history at the Malvern Museum, inside a medieval gatehouse on Abbey Road, or soak in the natural spring water at The Malvern Spa. The hot spring in what we now call the city of Bath was in use long before the Romans arrived in Britain in 43 CE a local tribe had been worshipping a goddess they called Sulis there for many years. The Romans, however, had grander plans and went on to build a huge bathing complex, all fed by that same hot spring. Much later, in the 18th century, King George III was the power behind Baths eventual transformation into Englands most popular spa town. Today, the citys most famous landmarks include the Roman Baths, an ancient complex of pools where Romans bathed while paying their respects to Sulis Minerva, the goddess of healing artefacts on display include a bronze statue of the deity. To live like a Roman, head to the adults-only Thermae Bath Spa, which has several pools filled with 35.5C spring water. Going to Bath? Here is where you should stay. Cheltenhams healing waters were discovered in 1716 when, according to legend, a landowner noticed pigeons gathering around a spring, pecking at salt deposits. The site soon became Cheltenhams first spa, while the pecking pigeons became the towns symbol and now adorn its signposts. Soon, aristocrats, royalty and writers were flocking to Cheltenham to drink and bathe in the waters, which were recommended by doctors as a cure for everything from pimples to ulcers. The towns numerous spa buildings included Pittville Pump Room, probably the grandest of the lot and still standing today it houses the original spa pump and you can even taste the famous water there a word of warning  its incredibly salty. The healing benefits of this towns spring water were first documented in the Middle Ages, and by the 1800s, the town was a magnet for water-based experiences thanks to its mineral-rich water, which wasnt just used to treat ailments such as gout and rabies, apparently, but also used by bakers to make bread and butchers to preserve meat. Today, Leamington Spas grandest landmark is the Royal Pump Rooms, now a museum packed with more than 12,000 artefacts that recount the history of the spa town. One of the best ways to learn about the areas history is on a free tour led by volunteers from the Leamington Society advance booking required. In 1606, Lord Dudley North came across a Kent spring filled with rust-coloured water and took a sip rejuvenated, he raved about the waters healing powers to friends, and soon, the water of Tunbridge Wells became known as a cure for everything from infertility to hangovers. Grand bath houses sprang up around the Chalybeate Spring, where dippers served glasses of water for a fee. Today, you can still visit the spring in The Pantiles, a Georgian colonnade built not long after Lord Dudley Norths discovery, and buy a bottle of the Royal TW Water for a taste of the slightly bitter but mineral-rich water.

For thousands of years, people have survived in the Alps with traditional, straightforward food and drink. From strudel to fondue, nothing beats tasting these dishes from where they originated. Harsh temperatures and unpredictable high-altitude soil have strengthened the roots of the Alps, and the farmers living there are as resilient as the food they grow. Here, people have survived the unimaginable In 1916, more than 200 Austro-Hungarian World War I soldiers lived at 12,000 feet for a year inside Italys Marmolada Glacier, in a city of ice tunnels they dug by hand, rationing bread and meat, and, when they could get it, a soft sweet bundt cake called gugelhupf to ease their pain. Those hidden ice trenches are now the site of another slow battle Climate change is expected to melt the glacier completely by 2040. Through thick and thin  traversing dangerous mountain passes in winter storms, avalanches, and in the face of climate change  lives in the Alps have depended on hearty Alpine sustenance food and drink. They ate to keep going. It was the fresh mountain air, water, and hearty food that also led to the birth of recreational skiing in Davos, Switzerland, after wealthy British visitors came to heal from tuberculosis in the late 1800s, convincing farmers to keep their inns open for winter skiing. Related Ski across the Dolomiteshome of the 2026 Olympics. And for 2,000 years, the people here have occupied cabins built by their ancestors, baking bread to last an entire year without a single preservative. They found the strength to survive in traditional straightforward dishes from potatoes, corn, vegetables, cured and smoked meats, aged cheeses, berries, and foraged ancient grains and herbs like mountain pine, and juniper. Since the Middle Ages, in the Alps, craftsmen, tradesmen, and salesmen traveled by foot for apprenticeships stopping in huts, where they would stay and eat hearty mountain food, says Sigrid Pilchler, of the Austrian Tourist Office, adding St. Christoph Arlberg Hospiz Hotel, which is now a luxury hotel, was one of the first its currently closed for renovations until 2026. Today, Alpine regions are defined by generational recipes, and food and drink is the source of pride. The best way to experience Alpine culture is hut-to-hut, eating cheesy dumplings, chunks of fatty speck bacon  cured in Tyrolean basements since the 1500s  fondue, of course, and schnaps spelled with one p, not two. Centuries later, 30,000 people are thriving in the remote Alta Badia valleys of the Italian Dolomites, practicing customs like traditional bread baking. In one of the last two commercial kitchens of Ladin families still baking Schüttelbrot, I mixed sticky spelt, barley malt, and rye flours with hearty herbs, caraway seeds, beer yeast, and sourdough, for digestion and protein. The smell of fennel reminds me, despite the areas Austrian, German, and Ladin influences, that Im still in Italy. Baker Nikolas Seppi placed his aromatic dough on a wooden paddle, spinning it outward, loosening, flattening, and drying the loaf from the inside out until it resembles a thin pita. Schüttelbrot, translating to shake bread, is all natural, no preservatives. Just store it in a bag on the counter, Seppi tells me, finally breaking the crunchy bread into pieces with his fist to eat with speck and aged alpine mountain cheese. It will last an entire year. Seppis baking class is part of Nos Ladins, which invites visitors and locals to carry on ancient practices against the odds of modernization. In the shadows of popular Dolomiti Superski resorts, you can also learn farming, foraging, weaving, mountaineering, and the Ladin language. You can also visit Nikolas Seppi and his family at Panificio Seppi bakery in the village of Corvara, home to Italys first chairlift. In the après-ski capital of the world, I watched three rowdy men in turtlenecks and ski boots chase a shot of schnaps with a chunk of fatty bacon. Here in St. Antons old wooden alpine Sennhütte distillery, traditional schnaps with 40 percent alcohol are not for the faint of heart. The distilled fruit and herbal liqueur digestif is everywhere. Tyrol is home to more schnaps distilleries around 4,000 per capita than any other region in the world. Many Austrian families still mash and distill their own schnaps from backyard apple, pear, and cherry trees, with water from the snow. The Krautinger turnip schnaps from Wildschönau has been made since the 1700s, when an empress gave 51 farmers the exclusive rights to produce it. Only 16 farmers are still allowed to make it. Austrian law once outlined specific standards for schnaps production, like limited labeling. That day, instead of bacon, I chased my pine schnaps with a dessert called kaiserschmarrn, a shredded egg-forward pancake topped with icing sugar from the owners family recipe. Churches blend into valley landscapes between the dramatic pink rock spires of Northern Italy, and inside warming huts, dumplings take center stage. Here, theres a castle church called Hocheppan that dates back to the 12th century inside youll find a fresco that features a woman eating a dumpling. The earliest recipe, called knödel in German and Austrian, was written in the 15th century, and every September Knödelfest still celebrates dumplings in medieval Sterzing, Italy. Rolled from stale bread, polenta, or potato with milk and sometimes egg, the dough balls are paired with Alpine regional flavors like spinach, beetroot, chive, speck, and cheese, then served in soup, with brown butter, or with a side of sauerkraut. The dumplings at Älpele, in Lech, Austria, are worth the trek. The only way to get to this 300-year-old traditional wooden hut is by foot, snowshoe, horse-drawn carriage, or snowcat. Apple strudel was the dish of Viennese nobles, and its still considered the national food of Austria, along with Wiener schnitzel and tafelspitz. Now, showcased behind glass counters in most ski huts, when youd expect cannoli or pizzelli, youll also find elastic layers of pastry dough hugging fresh apples, raisins, lemon juice, cinnamon, and pignoli nuts. In the upper Val Badia region of the Dolomites, La Perla hotel was founded by Ernesto and Anni Costa. Its one-Michelin-starred restaurant, La Stüa de Michil, serves locally sourced innovations rooted in tradition, including apple strudel  but only when its in season. While the earliest reference describing fondue was in Homers Iliad back in 800 to 725 BC, both the rural Alpine highlands and the French-speaking Rhone-Alpes region near Geneva take credit for modern fondue as we know it  without scrambled eggs. When winter food supply waned, Swiss farm families gathered round the fire dipping stale bread in melted cheese rinds and whatever wine was left. It didnt take long to name fondue the national Swiss dish in 1930, and it went on to become a symbol of Swiss unity after World War II, with fondue sets sent to military regiments. By the 1960s, fondue had made its way around the globe. The Cheese King of Gstaad shares his secrets to the perfect Swiss fondue. The Montana Stube in Davos, Switzerland, is still serving fondue a century after the restaurant was used as a sanatorium to heal the British from tuberculosis. Back then, it was all alpine pastures. Today, a 500-year-old Austrian farm is still standing mid-mountain in Oberlech. The Alter Goldener Berg is a traditional hut among the four restaurants of the opulent ski-in-ski-out Hotel Goldener Berg, and its also where I soaked up history and the best fondue Ive tasted yet. A yeasted bundt cake known as gugelhupf was rationed to Austro-Hungarian soldiers fighting a slow, strategic battle inside the Italian Dolomites Marmolada Glacier. The complex tunnels they dug deep within the areas highest mountain, called the Queen of the Dolomites, became their barracks, chapels, sanatoriums, and yes, kitchens, for eating this ring-shaped coffee cake. Head for the ski slopes of Asitz Mountain, in Leogang, Austria, for the traditional bundt cake from the kitchen of the Forsthofgut Naturhotel, a fifth-generation hotel and restaurant oasis since 1617. This contemporary nature hideaway offers sweeping alpine views and sprawling gardens, with alpaca trekking in the summer.

North AmericaChevron United StatesChevron CaliforniaChevron San FranciscoChevron In a new series, Place at the Table, we look at diasporic enclaves around the world through their cuisinesand the people who, in trying to recreate a taste of home, have forged exciting food scenes that invite others in. When you enter San Franciscos Mint Malljust one block south of trolley-lined Market Street, where international tourists are continuously afoot, in the SOMA South of Market districtyou might wonder if you took a wrong turn. Though you wouldnt guess from its near-vacancy, Mint Mall was once home to one of the citys most vibrant congregation of Filipino businesses, including a Pinoy bookstore, theater, and salon. But after being forcefully displaced by mass evictions in 2000, there are virtually no traces of Mint Malls Tagalog-rich past. Only one of those fixtures remains JT Restaurant. Formerly New Pilipinas, this humble eatery has been a mainstay since 1994. A de facto time machine, JT Restaurant is a bastion of no-frills national dishes. Inside, a clutter of tropical greenery flourishes beside faded, souvenir portraits of the Philippines. Cases of imported ingredientsmost prominently, Nilo Soursop, a popular Guanabana juiceteeter in stacks beside signs that advertise shipping services to Manila. Meanwhile, grandmotherly portions of pork sinigang tamarind broth, kare-kare oxtail in peanut butter sauce, dinuguan pork blood, lumpia fried spring rolls and palabok rice noodles beckon longtime and new patrons alike. Deanna Sison and chef Syl Mislang of Mestiza, a plant-forward Mexican Filipino spot in San Francisco Calabasa Coconut Stew and Rainbow Salad are on the menu at Mestiza, as are backyard kamayan feasts What the setting lacks in formal presentation, it more than compensates for in soulful comfort. To order at the counter, you simply point to the desired menu item with your finger a fast-food method known in the Philippines as turo-turo, which translates to point-point. The spirited owner and chef, Tess Diaz-Guzman, then jumps into action by heaping rice onto your plate and surrounding it with bowls of vinegary meats and savory stews to be poured atop the fluffy white grains. The whole experience feels jarringly out of place amid San Franciscos whirlwind of self-driving Waymo vehicles and OpenAIs nearby headquarters. And yet the contrast adds to JT Restaurants distinctly generational, unapologetically Pinoy vibes, an anchor in the ever-changing cityand SOMA in particular, which has been experiencing a revival since it was designated as SOMA Pilipinas, the citys Filipino Cultural Heritage District in 2016. The history of San Franciscos Filipino community dates back to the turn of the 20th century, when early waves of immigrants followed work opportunities to the States. From the 1920s to the 1970s, the downtown strip along Kearny Street where thousands of Filipinos lived was even known as Manilatown. In the 1970s, though, the area was razed to make way for the Manhattanization of San Francisco, and has since turned into the citys Financial District. Despite these systemic injustices, the Bay Areas Filipino population at-large remains the second largest in the country, with Daly City, a foggy, coastal suburb that borders San Franciscos periphery, ranking as the highest per capita concentration of Filipinos in the United States. That complex history remains at the heart of the regions contemporary mélange of food. Sarap Shops I Love My Adobro pita sandwich, stuffed with slow-braised pork, fried okra, pickled veggies, and fries Filipino food isnt historically beautiful, it isnt upscale, says Rocky Rivera, a rapper, community advocate, and journalist who was born in Angeles City in the Philippines before arriving in the Bay Area in 1986. Peasant food isnt sexy. Its economical. Its the kind of cooking youll compare to what you ate growing up. Rivera was raised in San Franciscos Treasure Island and Excelsior neighborhoods, both of which are on the citys outskirts, and the latter of which she champions as a trove of Filipino cuisine. While emphasizing the role of decolonization in food, she can rattle off a panoply of turo-turo joints, mom-and-pop bakeries, and divey haunts in the greater area. For Rivera, Cafe Colma at Lucky Chances Casino is an ideal spot to fill up, especially late night. A nondescript cardroom that doubles as a 24-hour diner, the casino slings life-changing plates of tocino silog, garlic rice, and eggs to go along with lechon kawali deep fried pork belly, beef kaldereta beef vegetable stew, and sinigang pork spareribs. She also points to a 167-year-old pub in Brisbane, just four miles south of the city. A wild west holdover, 7 Mile House even operated as a brothel and illegal gambling office in the 19th Century. The thing about Filipino American fare in the Bay is that it doesnt merely exist in hard-to-find, unlikely pockets. Its out in the open as a visible sign of the regions diasporic abundance. Thats increasingly true since SOMA gained its designation as the citys Filipino Cultural Heritage District. The community-led initiative has been overwhelmingly successful in catalyzing Filipino businesses and re-activating the neighborhoods potential for Filipino arts and cuisine. Spearheaded by Filipino entrepreneur Desi Danganan, the ever-shifting zip code encapsulates San Franciscos wealth of Fil-Am offerings, despite the tech-warped real estate market. Our vibranium is our culture, Danganan explained on This Filipino American Life Podcast. This is a mitigation strategy to stop the displacement of Filipinos. What better way to keep people gathered than with food? At Ox  Tiger, a speakeasy-esque Filipino-Japanese hideaway north of Market Street, founders EJ and Hitomi serve a four-course prix-fixe meal. The effort has attracted a fresh wave of businesses to reinforce the legacy of Filipinos in the community. In 2024, The Sarap Shopa lauded food truckopened its inaugural storefront and entrepreneurial incubator on Stillman Street. Led by Kristen Brillantes and JP Reyes, in partnership with Danganans Kultivate Labs, they represent the newest generation of San Franciscos gourmandry. Here, bottles of plant-based Halo Halo milk tea inspired by the classic Filipino dessert of ice cream, ube jam, sweet beans, coconut, pinipig, and more and original dishes like lechon sisig carbonara mac tamarind-kissed pork belly, longanisa bacon bits, and shaved parmesan over elbow macaroni and creamy carbonara sauce are worth the hype. Rotating fusions like an adobo pita sandwich, with slow-braised pork chunks layered beneath fried okra, pickled veggies, French fries and garlic sauce, round out the imaginatively playful menu. Having also arrived in recent years, Mestizaa Mexican Filipino hotspot dishing out 13-inch vegan lumpia and group-sized kamayan feasts in a verdant back patiois within short walking distance. If youre looking for an upscale experience, Ox  Tiger awaits, a speakeasy-esque Filipino Japanese hideaway that only accepts reservations on weekends, and is tucked inside a narrow, izakaya-style sit down north of Market Street. The four-course pre-fixe meals feature innovative Filipino and Japanese plates and desserts that can be paired with a sake tasting cured salmon topped with pickled ampalaya bitter melon, sitaw string beans, and salmon skin chicharon. Theres also Abacá along Fishermans Wharf, a contemporary Filipino darling known for its meaty skewers and chorizo-stuffed squid relleno. Anchoring it all is Señor Sisig, largely credited as the originator of Filipino fusion street food in the Bay Area when it launched in 2010, having since expanded to multiple locations sinceall of which are beloved for their Mission-style burritos with pork or tocino, and sweet and sour sinigang wings. Fried chicken is served at Señor Sisig, which is credited with leading Filipino fusion street food in the Bay Area over the past decade. Bay Area-born Filipino-American rapper P-Lo collaborated with Señor Sisig on their crispy sinigang wings. I grew up in Daly City which is 95 Filipino and thats all I knew and ateat places like Ling Nam and Cafe Colma, and nowadays Chibog, says Gil Payumo, the founding chef of Señor Sisig. The concept is to get Filipino food out to the masses. We want to be a gateway for that to happen. Notably, because of the Bays diverse fabric, Filipino food has been able to pair itself with other cuisines, including Mexican and Italian, allowing Pinoy ingredients to reach a wider audience. Within a fusion-friendly ecosystem, chefs like EJ Macayan of Ox  Tiger are able to emphasize their Filipino heritage in heartfelt wayslike swapping out beef and ketchup to create a pork cheek and bagoong fermented, fish-based condiment burger, or an updated take on bulalo, a Filipino stew that Macayan prepares with bone-in short rib infused with Shirasu Japanese anchovies. There used to be a presumption that Filipino food is just deep-fried, heavy, and fatty, says Macayan, whose family is from the Ilocos region of the Philippines. But todays Filipino food goes against that stereotype to show how there is much more to offer. Each restaurant has their own creative interpretation for what it means to them. Im really proud of seeing that growth in the last few years.

Melodic mantras and warm oil repeatedly poured across the lower back are parts of Kati Vasti, an Ayurvedic therapy that Karina Steward, founder and chief wellness officer of Kamalaya Wellness Sanctuary in Koh Samui, Thailand, swears would put anyone in a pleasure coma. Its like when you rub oil on the back of a baby and they just pass out, she explains. But for women experiencing menopause, who are subject to nervous system overload, adrenal burnout, and sleeplessness, such treatments can feel especially powerful, Steward notes. Its one of many tools in Kamalayas new Radiant Bliss program, a combination of Eastern and Western therapies. Stewart designed it to address womens health concerns at all points in the biological cycle, but the program particularly helps those enduring the mood swings, hot flashes, weight gain, and insomnia that are part of what was once referred to as the change. Cringey euphemisms for the midlife hormonal shift used to be commonplace. But today menopause and its harbinger, perimenopause which can strike women as early as their 30s, have shed their Geritol-tinged stigma, thanks in part to the openness of stars whove gone through them Oprah Winfrey and Drew Barrymore discussed hot flashes and hormone replacement therapy HRT in their special program The Menopause Talk, while Naomi Watts unveiled her meno-beauty brand Stripes at membership club The Swells New Pause Symposium in New York and LA tagline Were coming in hot!. Rancho La Puerta grows much of its own food, including olives and citrus, on its 4,000-acre grounds in Baja Light bites at Sha Wellness Clinic in Spain Now the same generation that once pushed for insurance coverage of IVF and breastfeeding pods at the office are flocking to spas and wellness retreats with programming that specifically addresses menopause. Spains esteemed Sha Wellness Clinic recently opened a sexual health unit, prompted by a shift in societal attitudes and a growing interest from our guests in addressing these issues, says Cinthya Molina, a clinical psychologist who heads the program. Guests are assigned therapies based on balancing all hormonal axes through nutrition, exercise, and supplementation, including plant-based bioidentical hormones. Some may also be candidates for a prescription of HRT. In fact, with hormone replacement therapy still a fraught issue in the USwhere the medical establishment has slowly re-embraced it after a faulty 2002 study connected it to elevated breast cancer and heart disease riskmany women are seeking guidance at wellness clinics. The seven-night program for menopausal women at Villa Stephanie in Baden-Baden, Germany, for instance, offers a cornucopia of protocols, including bioidentical hormone replacement therapy, mental health consultations, acupuncture, hiking, and a tailored dietary plan that targets glucose metabolism to regulate hormones. At 1 Hotel Hanalei Bay in Kauai, Hawaii, women work with experts to unlock the power of biology with a panoply of tailored therapies, including a comprehensive hormone assessment, nutrient therapy, and personalized bioidentical hormone replacement with fun gizmos for symptom management, like an ocean float room to relieve muscle aches and compression leg cuffs to boost circulation. Taking a less medicalized though no less immersive path, meno-focused group retreats are attracting adherents. Baja-based wellness pioneer Rancho La Puerta is hosting an Iyengar Yoga workshop for perimenopause, with a focus on asanas that address hot flashes, insomnia, and mood swings. And Amilla Maldives recently held a four-day Pause Retreat consisting of meditation, yoga, sound therapy, massage, and breath work that was so popular the resort plans to do it again. Women loved that they had the time to learn about the changes taking place in their bodies, says general manager Narelle McDougall, and ways to transition whilst enjoying their dream holiday. Those who dont want a multiday commitment can opt for a quickie treatment at Chewton Glen, in South East England, called Menopause and Restore, which aims to address emotional heaviness while decreasing inflammation in the body. Mii Amo in Sedona, Arizona, reopened its renovated spa with a workshop that addresses challenging life stages, while Miraval offers classes that address this transition, including a Pelvic Floor Wisdom offering. At Nayara Tented Camp in Costa Rica, the Rite of the Womb ritual, based on initiation traditions of Amazonian and Andean shamans, is offered to women who are pregnant, entering menopause, or have had hysterectomies. Which may point to the most lasting antidote of all, and one that underscores why we travel. In places where traditional cultures still flourish, says Kamalayas Stewartlike her homeland of Mexico, or her adopted one of Thailandelders are revered and treated with kindness. If we have a negative image of what menopause is, if we fight it, it will be a disaster. Yes, its a closure, but Im finding it is also the biggest rebirth. Its truly liberating. I hope that women can work with their health both internally and physically to experience menopause not as a decline, but a metamorphosis.
