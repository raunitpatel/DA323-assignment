Previous Wordle solutions can help to eliminate guesses for todays Wordle, as the answer isnt likely to be repeated. They can also give you some solid ideas for starting words that keep your daily puzzle-solving fresh. Here are some recent Wordle answers There are six rows of five boxes presented to you by Wordle each day, and youll need to work out which five-letter word is hiding among them to win the daily puzzle. Start with a strong word like ALIVEor any other word with a good mix of common consonants and multiple vowels. You should also avoid starting words with repeating letters, so you dont waste the chance to confirm or eliminate an extra letter. Once youve typed your guess and hit Enter, youll see which letters youve got right or wrong. If a box turns , it means that letter isnt in the secret word at all.  means the letter is in the word, but not in that position.  means youve got the right letter in the right spot. Your second guess should compliment the first, using another good word to cover any common letters you might have missed on the first rowjust dont forget to avoid any letter you now know for a fact isnt present in todays answer. After that, its just a case of using what youve learned to narrow your guesses down to the correct word. You have six tries in total and can only use real words and dont forget letters can repeat too eg BOOKS.

Originally, Wordle was dreamed up by software engineer Josh Wardle, as a surprise for his partner who loves word games. From there it spread to his family, and finally got released to the public. The word puzzle game has since inspired tons of games like Wordle, refocusing the daily gimmick around music or math or geography. It wasnt long before Wordle became so popular it was sold to the New York Times for seven figures. Surely its only a matter of time before we all solely communicate in tricolor boxes.

Im the King of the Losers. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Heres how it works. I adore co-op horror games with a dumb premise, horrific monsters, funny physics, and an endless story in which my friends and I can devote hours on hours to trying to concur and inevitably only get worse at. So it should come as no surprise that Semiworks new game, R.E.P.O. Repo, has quickly become a staple among my Discord friends. Identically to Lethal Company, the premise is to collect trinkets and hit a quota set by some faceless greedy boss. But unlike other co-op horror games, where the biggest obstacle is all the monsters that roam around the maps, Repo has that plus a physics system that will make transporting your loot much more stressful, accident-prone, and slapsticky. You cant just place an item in your inventory or even carry it with your bare hands. Instead, you use a tool that grabs onto an item and levitates it off the ground, much like how the portal gun can pick up and hold objects. This may help when it comes to picking up larger items like TVs but every time you accidentally knock your item into a wall or another player it depreciates in value, and if you drop a breakable item like a plate or a crystal then itll smash into a million pieces and be of no value to anyone. But I only heard this from a friend. Its not like I dropped a really expensive vase and cost my team the whole game I wouldnt do something like that. One of the most endearing parts of Repo has to be the robot, sardine-like player characters that talk like the Canadians from South Park. The proximity chat detaches your characters jaw relative to how much volume youre spitting through the mic. Its unspeakably funny watching one of my friends run from a killer clown while their head is completely cocked back screaming at the top of their lungs. But you know whats not funny? Having to put yourself through hell time and time again with no respite just to earn your crummy boss who doesnt even like you some extra cash. Like other co-op horror games, Lethal Company, Content Warning, and Phasmophobia, Repo is a roguelike, meaning you carry on going in a run until you all die or fail to meet the quota. This means dying is expected, and only feels bad when youve managed to reach a respectively high level or youre just about to break a personal best. But so far, my friends and Ive only made it past level 3, so were not really playing high stakes yet. Keep up to date with the most important stories and the best deals, as picked by the PC Gamer team. But even if you die, you can still win, kind of. Failing to meet a quota means your boss will send you down the trash shoot and force you to battle it out to decide who the king of the losers is. I felt like I was in the Colosseum the first time I was dropped down onto the small structure full of random trinkets like teddy bears and weapons like grenades, a great sword, and my personal favourite, a massive inflatable hammer. I also want to note that Im currently the King of the Losers amongst my friends after defending the title three times, the third of which I accidentally killed everyone including myself, but I won by default, so Im claiming it. R.E.P.O. is also full of creative and deadly monsters, like any good chaotic co-op horror game. So far, Ive come across the Headman, a giant floating head thatll try and eat you, the Reaper, a doll with blades for arms, the Mentalist, a floating alien that can kill you with its mind, and the Clown, which can fire off a laser beam which can also instantly kill you. Some of the monsters are more aggressive than others, and some even try to kill you with kindness, like the cute little duck that bumps items out of your hands and turns into a man-eating monster if you try to pet it. But otherwise, there are no massively distinctive traits between enemies yet. These guys may be scary, but theyre nothing compared to the Huntsman and those dastardly gnomes. My only advice when it comes to dealing with the Huntsman would be to run and hide. The Huntsman is absolutely lethal, and all it is is some random dude with a shotgun. The Huntsman is blind but has ridiculously good hearing. He can track you down no matter where you are on the map, and he has a fantastic shot, so he rarely ever misses you. One time, I retreated back to the van to get some health and pick up a bat because Id had enough of being pushed around. But unfortunately, I didnt have the chance to take out my aggression because as soon as I turned around, the Huntsman was there with his shotgun inches away from my face. Needless to say, I had my head taken clean off, and we ended up losing that round. My only advice when it comes to dealing with the Huntsman would be to run and hide while hes reloading the shotgun, as that takes a while, and then crouch-walk around until youre sure hes gone. Still, the Hunstman is nowhere near as annoying as those bloody gnomes. These little guys dart around the map, nipping at your heels and destroying any precious items youve managed to collect. At one point, I had to fight a horde of them off, picking them up and smashing them into one another. It was brutal there were porcelain shards scattered all over the ground, and I was left with only 1 HP. My bloody fight scared them away for a bit, letting us collect a few more trinkets. But sadly, another group soon found us, and after fending off the backup gnomes for as long as I could, I went down with one blow to my heel. I was like Achilles, except more heroic. Repo is a fantastic co-op horror game that can hold its own against big shots like Lethal Company. Its also only in early access right now, and with plans to introduce more player customisation, story elements, equipment, levels, and enemies, all I can say is that Im really looking forward to seeing where the devs take this co-op horror game.

Breaking down all the choices big and small. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Heres how it works. In the lead-up to Avoweds launch, game director Carrie Patel quoted its ending permutations as being in the double digits, and having seen the end, I dont even have to get into more granular quest results to come up with a similar number. There are two major choices at the end of the game that determine your main ending variations, with little choices throughout the game that then affect how happy or sad it all is. Ive organized this guide to go over the two divergence points, with a section at the end covering the smaller quests reflected in the ending slideshow, and how I think different choices play off, complement, or contradict each other. As a note You can indicate your preference for different end states like an independent Living Lands throughout the game, but this doesnt lock you in to one choice or another. You can even pull a switcheroo and side with the Steel Garrote right at the very end of the game, even if you spared Sapadalthough that choice has its own, unique consequences. The first major choice youll encounter after Avoweds point of no return is whether to kill or spare Sapadal, the god living in your head. Though there are three distinct choices, how you behave toward Sapadal throughout the game may influence your ending slides if you spare her. All three choices bring an end to the Dreamscourge. Sparing Sapadal lends itself the most to an independent Living Lands, but this choice does not appear to have any direct conflicts with Avoweds political endingswith the notable exception of siding with the Steel Garrote and Lödwyn. Releasing Sapadal brings an end to the Dreamscourge. One of the final ending slides describes Sapadals character and attitude toward the Living Lands and its people. The only variation Ive seen so far describes them calming down and learning to value life, but its possible this is contingent on how you speak to them and the example you set throughout the game, with the possibility of Sapadal becoming a more vengeful deity in response to ruthless or callous characters. If this ending does exist, it may require you to kill Ygwulf in Paradis along with other early game ruthless choicesRadio Times Gaming on YouTube noted that they were unable to get a vengeful Sapadal ending slide after sparing Ygwulf but encouraging the gods darker urges. Sparing Sapadal and giving them the Adra mech in Sargamis quest early in the game will result in a special ending slide describing how the god makes use of it. Its unclear if this is similarly contingent on how you influence Sapadals morality, but the slide I got showed a very sweet, Iron Giant sort of situation. Killing Sapadal is a victory for the original pantheon of Eora, particularly Woedica, and dovetails the most with the various shades of pro-Aedyr endings in the subsequent major choice. Killing Sapadal while pushing for an independent Living Lands feels like a real mismatch, but the end slides wont ding you for it. Killing Sapadal ends the Dreamscourge just as if you saved them. As a note Sapadal and the other gods relationship takes on a different character if you played Pillars of Eternity. At the end of the first Pillars, its revealed that the main pantheon of Eora are artificial beings, brought to life by an ancient civilizations mass sacrifices and powerful magic. Sapadal, being a similar entity born from a gradual loss of life and accumulation of souls with no mortal hand behind it, could thus be argued to be the only true or natural deity in the setting. I didnt even realize this was an option before watching Radio Times Gamings ending guide for Sapadal, and this strikes me as a darker, bad ending option, even more so than killing the deity. You get new, more Sapadal-centric dialogue options and interjections during the final battle, and Lödwyn has special dialogue for if you go this route. The ending slide reveals that Sapadal fully overtakes and buries your original personality, reminding me of the Mind Flayer ending for Baldurs Gate 3. The Dreamscourge, though, is once again defeated. There are four main political outcomes for the Living Lands that you can choose during the council with the Living Lands political leaders before the final battle in Dawnshore Steel Garrote victory, Aedyran colony, Aedyran gréfram, and independent Living Lands. Nothing technically locks you out of siding with Lödwyn and alienating all your companions, no matter what choices youve made throughout the game, but unless you kept to an ardently pro-Steel Garrotte path, Lödwyn will execute you as a traitor at the last moment, leading to a truncated ending sequence where she takes over without you. The choices you have to make to avoid this are Do all of that, and Lödwyn knights you as a paladin of the Steel Garrotte, letting you survive to see her bring the Living Lands to heel. Dont you feel nice? The slightly less fascist ending thats still pretty grim. If Lödwyns ending is like letting Caesar die in New Vegas then siding with Lanius, this one is like the good karma Caesars Legion ending. Aedyr takes over direct governance of The Living Lands, and some of your settlement choices can play off this ending in particularly happy or dark ways Ah, a moderate, are we? Bet you were a Normal or Sorry copotype in Disco Elysium. Illuminati ending in Deus Ex. Why cant we all just get along? No matter. The Living Lands gets kinda colonized by Aedyr, but still has a say in its own governance. Things are a bit nicer for Solace, Fior, and Thirdborn, but we can do better. Pick a side, man. Hell yeah, baby. No gods, no masters. Yes Man ending. Results in a very positive ending for an intact Fior, Mihala-led Solace, and a Paradis where Ygwulf wasnt killed. I cant speak to how things turn out here if Kostya destroys Solace or Fior is allowed to burn, and I have yet to see a happy ending for Thirdborn under any of the major paths more on that below.

March has arrived and its full of uncertainty. Will Borderlands 4 suck? Will Grand Theft Auto VI cost 100? What beloved game studios will be closed so massive publishers can get back their swagger? Will tariffs kill physical games or is Trumps trade war still in early access? The only thing we know for sure is what we plan to play this weekend. Here are six games occupying our time that well think you might like too. 2  8 Play it on PC Goal Ponder and pontificate I fucking love Danganronpa creator Kazutaka Kodakas work. The Danganronpa series is a foundational text for me, even as it has been turned into a distorted meme of itself in Too Online spaces. Ive been keeping up with Kodakas projects since he left Spike Chunsoft, and while I enjoyed his teams paranormal murder mystery Master Detective Archives Rain Code and the cyberpunk anime Akudama Drive, I also started to get the unnerving sense that he might just have two ideas he likes to riff on, and that hes maybe just been playing those hits ever since Danganronpa V3 Killing Harmonys meta commentary made a big stink about wanting to do something new. That feeling was only made more apparent when I played the demo of his upcoming game, The Hundred Line Last Defense Academy. The tactical RPG shares an artist and composer with Danganronpa, and is somehow also about a bunch of kids getting trapped in a school and being threatened by a cartoon mascot. Though its not a murder mystery, it feels like a new Danganronpa game, just without all the lore necessary to prop up a death game. Despite its violent premise of imprisoned high school kids forced to fight in a war against alien invaders, it feels like comfort food from a team whose work I enjoy, even as it makes me wince when it leans into weird tropes Im surprised that team hasnt outgrown. I want to play at least a little bit more of the demo because its progress will carry over to the final game, but Im mostly just curious to see if Kodaka has run out of ideas.  Kenneth Shepard 3  8 Play it on PC Goal Get to the end Ground Shatters medieval follow-up to its John Wick-infused Fights in Tight Spaces is Slay the Spire meets Into the Breach. In Knights in Tight Spaces you have traditional classes like knights, mages, and archers governed by decks of cards you build up over a run. Instead of worrying about maneuvering a lone character through impossible odds, you have a whole party this time around who are limited to using the cards that correspond to their skills. Its the same, neat tactical idea of the original blown up with new options and challenges. Im enjoying it so far, though there are definitely ways it feels a bit more cumbersome than the original. Medieval tactics is way more my style though.  Ethan Gach 4  8 Play it on PC Goal Pull off some sick combos Because of the reveal of Tony Hawks Pro Skater 34 earlier this week, Ive had Tony Hawk and skateboarding on my brain. So I decided to check out a fan-created PC mod, THAWED, that updates Tony Hawks American Wasteland to make it playable on modern PCs and adds a ton of new features as well as support for old levels and modded skaters. And folks, Im happy to report that once I got it working, I had a great time. Ive played a lot of THUGPro, a different fan mod that aims to update THUG 2 with custom content, and I was still impressed by THAWED and its level of customization. If you are a THPS nerd, youll love this thing. You can change which skating physics to use. Prefer how THPS 12 felt, but like THUG2s on-foot gameplay? You can tweak THAWED to get that exact experience. Its very nice! It makes me really wish Activision would just re-release all the old games as one big collection separate from the remakes. But thats unlikely to happen, so instead Ill just keep playing THAWED this weekend.  Zack Zwiezen 5  8 Play it on PS5, Xbox Series XS, PC Goal Hit Hunter Rank 100. I reviewed Monster Hunter Wilds and have already dumped 50 hours into the kill, loot, craft hamster wheel but Im still going back for more. I cant get enough of Capcoms latest action-RPG. The moment-to-moment action remains as taut and satisfying as it was in hour one, and the company remains second to none when it comes to combat tuning and animation. There are not a lot of surprises here, but whats under the hood is so strong it doesnt really matter. I cant wait to Platinum this thing on PlayStation.  Ethan Gach 6  8 Play it on Switch Online Goal Get back in touch with my inner eight-year-old When I was very young, I thought the original Donkey Kong arcade game was just about the best thing ever. Sure, at a certain point its four stages just looped endlessly, but its gameplay was so enjoyable and challenging and its characters so distinct and memorable that I was happy to pump quarter after quarter into it in pursuit of a high score. And hey, there was plenty of merchandise and even a Saturday morning cartoon to remind me of Mario and his simian nemesis when I wasnt at the arcade. By the time 1994 rolled around, however, Id mostly forgotten my youthful adoration of the game, having grown accustomed to much more sophisticated fare like Myst, Wing Commander, and Ultima Underworld. I didnt think a throwback to the 1981 arcade game could knock my socks off, but it sure did. See, in this Game Boy mega-update to the original, when you beat the fourth stage of the arcade game, your adventure is only just beginning, as Donkey Kong snatches Pauline again and leads you on an epic chase across dozens of clever puzzle-platforming stages. As I told Ethan when he asked me what makes the game so special, it feels like a glimpse into an alternate world of Mario platforming, because this isnt quite the Mario we know from the SMB games. Its one that feels as if hes organically evolved from the stiff, hammer-wielding hero he was in the original Donkey Kong, though with his own new bag of tricks. Its now been many, many years since I played this version of DK, long enough that Ive mostly forgotten everything about it, so Ill definitely be curling up with it on my Switch this weekend and giving it a chance to wow me all over again.  Carolyn Petit 7  8 Play it on PS5, Xbox Series XS, PC Goal Develop my skills as a budding filmmaker God, the faces in this game. Theyre so human, authentic, vulnerable, expressive. I just want to look at them, to see what they reveal and what they hide, just like the faces of real people do. Im maybe three hours into the first part of Lost Records Bloom  Rage, the new game from Life Is Strange creators Dont Nod, and Im captivated. It shares some of the DNA of the original LISthis, too, is at times a wistful look at teen experience, in all its awkwardness and intensitybut theres a wrinkle you also see these characters in their 40s, in the present day, as they look back on a fateful 90s summer in their teen years. Being a 90s teen whos now in my 40s myself, Im intrigued to see just what the game does with the perspective this time jump gives its characters. You play as Swann, an aspiring filmmaker at least when she was a teen, and I love the way the game lets you capture footage with her camcorder and stitch it together into little montages. Theres an openhearted authenticity to it it feels like Swann is just experimenting, pursuing her creative impulses wherever they take her without overthinking it or worrying too much about doing it the right way, which is precisely what I think teens should do as they grow into real artists. Also, the atmosphere is impeccable. I just want to bask in the vibes of this game. I still dont know much about where the story is going, but Ill certainly be completing the first part of Lost Records this weekend and finding out more about whatever happened that summer, all those years ago.

Analogue 3D is the retro console makers take on the Nintendo 64. For 250 it will play your old The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time and Banjo-Kazooie cartridges in 4K. It was supposed to arrive this year but has unfortunately been delayed until 2025. Boutique retro console maker Analogue, which teased the console last year, is billing it as The unmistakable Signature and Soul of the CRT. On your HDTV. In 4K. Thats a tall order, but selling retro magic has been the companys ethos for years, beginning with the SNES-inspired Super NT, and then the Analogue Pocket, based on the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance. Like those systems, the Analogue 3D uses FGPA technology to recreate the N64 at the hardware level rather than relying on emulation and will be compatible with all N64 cartridges youll need to own the physical games rather than use ROMs. It also includes four original controller ports for your old, tri-pronged paddles, and comes with a new operating system that should make navigating menus and taking screenshots a much breezier experience. Analogue has developed the first, ultimate solution to play N64 today in total fucking glory, CEO Christopher Taber told Kotaku last year. Despite all of the amazing love, effort and work that developers have put into the software emulation of the N64it results in an experience that feels unjustly and wrongly agedgenerally off. Flatly not a good experience. Coupled with Original Display Modes recreating not just the video game system, but the other critical contextual pieces analog televisions, CRTsits difficult to overstate how fucking mint Analogue 3D is. While 250 covers the price of the console, an 8BitDo 64 controller will be sold separately that connects wirelessly for just 40. The N64 was home to GoldenEye 007, Mario Kart 64, the original Super Smash Bros., and tons of Mario Party games. Analogue touts it as one of the best retro couch co-op consoles of all time. Hopefully the 8BitDo 64 controller can support that dream with limited lag for anyone who doesnt have their old N64 controllers lying around, or, more likely, busted the center joysticks on them long ago. The Analogue 3D comes in both white and black, and pre-orders will be available starting on October 21 at 1100 a.m. ET. The companys CEO, Christopher Taber, previously told Kotaku that since its not a limited-edition product, we will produce to meet demand and continue to make Analogue 3D available into the foreseeable future. Its a shame it wont make it out in time for the holidays, but the company says orders will start shipping out in the first quarter of 2025.
