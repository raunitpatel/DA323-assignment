Things you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission It started with a bad performance review. My boss sat across from me in a glass conference room, with me facing the hallway, and he said, Youre not going to be happy with this. My chest tightened, and I realized I had forgotten my tissues. Id got a two out of five  an adult D  on my performance. He said I hadnt met the mark in my management I hadnt executed ideas the way he thought I should have and I was overall disappointing, especially for someone who had come in with so much buzz or something to that effect. It was my first time getting anything but glowing feedback from a manager. I started sobbing hysterically, tears and snot pouring out of me. It was so embarrassing Anyone who walked by could see me. I couldnt get myself out of there fast enough. I was so upset that I couldnt go back to my desk. Instead, I went to the bathroom and texted a colleague to bring my sweater and purse to a stall so I could leave the building quietly. I then sat outside in a newly built miniature park for a few hours, convulsing with sobs  the kind of cry that is about much more than the one thing you say you are crying about. As I sat on this bench in the middle of this weirdly paved, try-too-hard nonpark in downtown NYC, a nice man asked me in a comforting New York accent, You OK, sweethawt? Can I get you anything? Dont cry! He then ran to a nearby pretzel cart, bought me a bottle of water, put his hand on my shoulder, and said, Whatever it is, itll get better. I felt so stupid, crying in public like I had lost someone. I mean, I guess I had I had lost myself. I was raised in and brainwashed by hustle culture and external definitions of success. But I had to be, as the child of immigrants, as part of a generation that internalized the work hard, play hard ethic and the belief that women are as good as, if not better than, the men around them. I blogged and wrote books on the side while managing completely different careers  teaching, community organizing, and then digital communications. I had been the executive editor at the popular early-aughts feminist blog Feministing, where I would work in my free time, largely unpaid, blogging and mentoring other writers. I didnt even get a job in journalism until I was thirty-seven, but because Id had so many side gigs freelance writing and editing for free, I qualified for a senior-level job when I did. Over the previous ten years, Id become the poster child for the maxim fake it till you make it  a piece of advice I both followed and was quick to dole out to friends, mentees, and colleagues. Add to this that I was never good with boundaries at work If someone was willing to pay me to work, and especially for something for which I had a passion, I felt like I had to work twice as hard to prove myself. Need me to work late all week to make that unreasonable deadline? No problem, chief! Did another employee drop the ball on something they should have handled? Ill cover for them and then maybe do their task myself. Was the boss asking me to take on a workstream that was most definitely not in my job description? I was on it. I could not say no if I tried. As a Gen X woman, I was fed strong myths about the benefits of working hard, which then made me feel like shit if I wasnt always working. It helped me beast my career, but it also meant that when I hit forty, I was exhausted. I somehow went back into the office and got through the rest of the day after that but called in sick for the rest of the week. It wasnt just that I couldnt get out of bed I started to have intense chest pains, and when I wasnt feeling those, I was imagining myself jumping in front of one of the buses that ran up First Avenue next to my fourth-floor walk-up, or wondering what would happen if I took a whole handful of my Xanax prescription. Thats when I knew things were bad bad, so I called my best friend, who said we could talk about what happened later but that I needed to hang up and call my doctor right away and tell her everything, too. I emailed my doctor instead, and she told me to come in right away. I had struggled with bouts of depression, but it had never been like this, I told her. She switched my medication to something to manage the anxiety and the depression without the risks of suicidal ideation and suggested I take off as much time as possible  one month at the minimum, but I should consider much longer. I said, There is literally no way, so we agreed to three weeks. She wrote me a note, and I was in the clear for a little while I didnt have to go in to work and face the reality that the people who were then in charge of me didnt think I was very good at what I do. I had hit my breaking point, but I wasnt even aware of it yet I was still focused on getting better to get back to work. I went to stay with my parents for a week, but our cozy upstate home had essentially transformed into a medical facility to deal with my fathers end-stage renal disease. My mother suggested I check into a retreat center Id visited in the past and liked, and so I did, spending the rest of my medical leave lying on the floor in yoga class. After I returned to the office, things were  not surprisingly  awkward. My job duties were slowly given to a new hire with a stronger background in organizational management. I see now that the writing was already on the wall and had been even before the performance review. But at the time I didnt get it. I was on good terms with everyone, including my bosses. I was still working on projects and collaborating with colleagues. I thought that I would just continue on in my job. Im the person everyone likes  thats my whole thing, my survival skill. I kept thinking that it was all going to be relatively OK till one day, a few weeks after I returned, the inevitable happened I was fired. I mean, technically, I was laid off. Everyone told me it was not about my talent but about a strategic redirect, and I was one of several employees whose positions were being eliminated. I was told my departure could be framed to everyone as a transition, and I had the option to continue to work for the company on a freelance basis. Management had tried their best to help me save face, but the damage was done. I was enraged, devastated, and destabilized I felt gaslit and betrayed. I was also fucked financially because I had just helped my parents relocate to that cozy upstate home and was footing a good bit of the bill. When I got back to my apartment that night after a terrible day, I looked around at my couch, my window  it all looked different. It was never officially diagnosed as such, but after my bad review I suffered what I now know are the symptoms of a nervous breakdown. I was taking a few different types of medication, drinking too much alcohol, and turning to late-night eating to keep my feelings of abject failure at bay. In the middle of this, I had a book coming out. Instead of spending some time working through whatever was happening and it was clear to me even then that it wasnt entirely about losing my job, there was a book tour to go on. Flights around the country. Media appearances. The need for big smiles and polished hair and being on in interviews. And then, four months later, I got an email inviting me to interview for the executive editor job at Teen Vogue. I took the job but hadnt fully recovered from the layoff. I still had bad work-life boundaries I was emotionally unstable and hadnt processed anything that had happened. Most people didnt see this part of it  they saw me coming off a successful book tour and starting a fabulous new job. I was commended for my grit, hard work, and ability to build myself up from being an indie blogger to a major player in New York media. I was on a short-term high One place didnt want me, but another much more desirable, cool, and successful place did. I started the job like you start a rebound relationship when you arent over your ex I hit the ground running, posting nonstop selfies with my Drybar blowout and gifted plus-size fashion outfits, bragging about all the exciting and awesome things that were happening around me. I was the girl who had made it, sitting front row at New York Fashion Week. I spent a lot of time shuttling around the city in cabs  feet pinched in uncomfortable shoes, body stuffed into Spanx, jumping between the office, events, bars, and restaurants. A typical day started at eight a.m.  when Id roll over to grab my phone to open Slack and the Google News app to see what fresh hell the day had in store  and usually ended well after eight p.m., either because I worked late or because I had an event or was seeing friends, or sometimes just because I wasnt even sure what Id do at home in my studio apartment. I didnt have time to date  I was busy. The lifestyle was exhausting me, but I wasnt conscious of that  I was doing important work, which was what mattered. This is the price of success, I told myself. You feel like shit all the time! I never acknowledged how much the failure at my previous job still rankled me or that I was deeply tired and depressed. But even though I didnt acknowledge my feelings, my body tried to make them visible to me I gained weight, I was chronically tired, and I had huge dark circles under my eyes. Whats inescapable to me now is how thoroughly I had bought into certain myths about what it means to be a woman who is getting ahead at work. I told myself I was loving it. I was like a coach who couldnt stop giving pep talks This is awesome or Im so happy to be here. And sometimes it was even true. If work meant sacrificing everything, then Id sacrifice. Then the pandemic hit. And as scared as I was in that first pandemic month, isolated in my apartment, I started to notice some changes. My joints hurt less. The bags under my eyes had started to fade, as did the constant feeling of dread Id had every night before going to bed. I noticed that in the Zoom window my face looked brighter. My body was communicating that it liked the forced break from hustling. I began to wonder if there was more to life than this career I had fought to build, this job I had killed myself to get. I moved upstate to live with my mother. What I thought would be a few weeks turned into five months of living in the woods of Putnam County. As New York City, and then the country, were hit with tragedy after tragedy  the endless loss of human life, our lives disrupted, our politics altered  I was going for walks in the woods and working at my job with a view of trees instead of skyscrapers. I was eventually forced to reckon with what a true path to a better life could be. I realized how much I had been aiming for other peoples goalposts  regularly overexerting myself to meet obligations to my job, my friends, and my family. I hadnt ever really given myself the space I needed to adjust to high-powered, high-stress jobs. Id started practicing fake it till you make it back in my twenties, and on some level, I was still faking it twenty years later. And I didnt even realize it, because I was pushing myself so hard all the time. Years after Id sat weeping by the hot dog cart, I kept obsessively going over the day when I got fired, again and again. In therapy, Id be raging, blaming everyone for what happened  and then I gradually started to see the complexity of the situation. I started to see what I couldnt see then I had also not been thriving in the position. And that was OK. Still, that rage was important. It uncovered something much deeper that Id been tap-dancing around for years, which was that, at my core, I doubted that I even had a right to a job like that in the first place. In the beginning, working from home had the energy of a snow day, but the work quickly started to feel more intense from endless Zoom meetings to new tasks and check-ins. There was a lot of anxiety about layoffs, and many of us were feeling the pull to overperform even while the world was falling apart. Days would go by when itd be dark outside, and Id realize I hadnt eaten that day or even brushed my teeth. I was severely burned out and crumbling under the pressure of being a leader in a moment of such transition. In March 2021, I quit my Teen Vogue job. I was fortunate to get space during the pandemic to reflect on what would make me happy  and it turned out it wasnt a fancy, big-shot full-time job. Despite the glossy exterior of working at a magazine, I was frustrated with the rat race and wanted to spend more time being creative and less managing an increasingly unhappy staff in the face of budget cuts, constant turnover, and living life during a time of endless turbulence. A lot of people have asked me why Id leave such a dream job What actually happened? many well-intentioned but extremely nosy friends and family members have asked, and Ive told them that I knew it was a dream job for someone other than me. Ive still struggled to figure out how to live life on my own terms while sustaining myself. Even now, I very rarely take a day off. The hustle for money or the right gig is constant. Making ends meet and ensuring I have health insurance has been challenging. I dont have a lot of savings, and with an increased cost of living and the additional financial responsibilities I now shoulder, Ive had to take several gigs just for the money. And even in those jobs that are supposed to be just for the money, I find it extremely challenging to disconnect from the work or not get upset if its going poorly. Work cant make you happy, sure, but when it makes you actively unhappy, it is awful. Making it is a myth to me not because I didnt make it. I did make it, and Im still making it Im still on the hamster wheel. I still work too much. I still have a hard time doing all the things that need to get done, let alone being able to think about the bigger picture. I have long been in a prison of my own ambition, stuck without a narrative for moving forward. Im slowly starting to find my way out. But it means accepting that success looks different than I thought it would. From the book THE MYTH OF MAKING IT A Workplace Reckoning by Samhita Mukhopadhyay.

Things you buy through our links may earn Vox Media a commission Are you suddenly smelling the salt air of Montecito and wishing you had the kind of kitchen that Nancy Meyers dreams of? Well, thats because we are mere days away from Meghan Markles next chapter. The former royals new Netflix show, With Love, Meghan, comes out next week, and this time shes just a normal woman who cant be perfect 247. That, at least, is what it seems like based on the snippets weve seen and her new low-maintenance Instagram presence. The truth is that there arent too many details about the show or its format, but heres everything we do know so far. With Love, Meghan is scheduled to drop on Netflix on March 4. Previously slated for a January release, the shows premiere was pushed back in the wake of the Los Angeles wildfires. In the meantime, Meghan has been keeping busy. Shes been perfecting her tone on Instagram, she rebranded her jam company, and shes been working on her vision board. The hustle never stops. Ever since striking out on their own in 2020, Meghan and Prince Harry have tried their hand at a bunch of different projects. Theyre still focused on philanthropy through their Archewell Foundation, but their attempts at being content creators havent been as successful. There was Meghans Spotify podcast, Archetypes, the sole result of a 20 million deal with the streaming service. On the podcast, Meghan spent 12 episodes talking to famous people about the various labels theyd been given. The couple also has a Netflix deal  worth a reported 100 million  which resulted in Harry and Meghan, a glossy docuseries about the couples personal life that drew a large audience but was met with a lukewarm reception from critics. Then came Harrys docuseries about polo, and the less said about that, the better. With Love, Meghan looks like it will be taking a different tack. In all of the promotional materials, there is an emphasis on abandoning perfection for the sake of joy. Meghan is just hanging out in her beautiful kitchen with her friends, and if the crudités plate doesnt look like a ten out of ten, well thats fine! They had fun making it! That, at least, is the vibe Im picking up on. One of the shows big selling points is that Meghans friends old and new are all over this thing. To her, a stranger is just a friend who hasnt been in your kitchen yet. One thing you have to respect is that Meghan is not just bringing in the most famous people she sort of knows. The shows cameos include Mindy Kaling but also Abigail Spencer, her longtime actual best friend. Meghan has invited a few notable chefs onto the show  Northern California icon Alice Waters is slated to appear, as is L.A. native Roy Choi. In a preview clip from Chois episode, we get more of a sense as to what the show might be like. The clip starts with Meghan saying, This is about connecting with friends and just learning. It then jumps into Meghan and Choi talking about growing up in L.A. and what Choi listens to while hes cooking, all while she arranges what looks like a salad and he cuts up fruit. To be polite, Ill just say that Ive seen more compelling television before. Oh, also, Harry will make an appearance. Duh. Based on the trailer, the show is not solely about cooking with your friends. Its about entertaining in general. As such, we do see Meghan going out into the world a few times. She picks vegetables from a garden, shes at the florist choosing different flowers I imagine she will be teaching us how to make a quick and easy floral arrangement, and, most importantly to me, Meghan dons a beekeepers suit. Yes! This is what I want to see Meghan Markle in kind of left-of-center situations that require a special outfit and the slightest risk of danger. Lets get her stomping grapes at a vineyard next season. That is the question, isnt it? Based solely on how quickly Meghan got to 2 million followers on Instagram and how many people have watched the trailer, I think there is certainly interest in the show. So even if its not good, I imagine it will be in the Netflix Top Ten for a few days, which might mean she sells a few more jars of As Ever jam. And really, isnt that what this is all about?

Soon after Donald Trump was sworn in for the second time, the internet started to fill up with clips of leftist vengeance, like the video of an anonymous body sprinting up to a Cybertruck and defacing its silver sheen with spray paint and a woman saying she used her daughters inheritance to buy a Corvette in reprisal for her having voted for Trump. This is dark woke. Its the newest evolution of what was once labeled, in Trumps first term, the dirtbag lefta name for young progressives who werent afraid to viciously mock their political opponents. Its things that you wouldnt normally say or do, made acceptable because theyre directed at Republicans. The idea is to subvert the qualities that people think made wokeness cringethe virtue policing, the polite when they go low, we go high posturingand go Joker Mode to Make Democrats Cool Again. What qualifies for dark woke, per social media A kid calling Trump GAY, AAP Rocky calling homophobia in hip-hop retarded in 2012, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez telling the woman behind the Libs of TikTok account to cry more and asking if shes triggered. One viral tweet described a dismal Travis Kelce stat from the Super Bowl0 RECEPTIONS IN POSTSEASON FIRST HALF FOR FIRST TIME IN CAREERas dark woke. The flurry of these memes comes in direct opposition to the flood of new executive orders every week, as Trump and Elon Musk attempt to dismantle the government in real time. Over the next four years, liberals will test a slew of stances and slogans to see what sticksand this is just the first spark of a wider reaction to Trump 2.0. There are already some hints of elected Democrats adopting it see California Rep. Robert Garcia saying hes imitating Marjorie Taylor Greenes playbook by bringing a dick pica photo of Muskto a DOGE subcommittee meeting. The culture war has splintered into a million digital skirmishes, where viral tweets can have butterfly effects, creating the illusion that one side is more dominant depending on what your algorithm surfaces. Surfing sites like X now can make it feel like youre trapped in a digital Times Square, where every screen is blasting some new atrocity or slur-filled post or far-right harassment campaign. Its frustrating, and dark woke offers something like an alternative. It could serve as a cathartic release for the many jaded progressives fed up with the tame grandstanding and insipid inertia of their partys leaders. And maybe at best, dark woke memes infesting the content streams will prime centrist Democrats for hardcore leftist awakenings. But right now, it mostly feels like an algorithmic fad built on quick thrills, destined to become cringe just like Dark Brandon did. Its a meme, not a movement, and many people are already dismissive of it. While the election wasnt a landslide, Trump is treating it like it was. Hes attempting to rewire the country with a dizzying sweep and a relentlessness. A viral aestheticbecause thats what dark woke is in its current form, a flimsy patchwork of amorphous vibes, a la cottagecoreisnt going to save the country. Its a hashtag, a tweet format you can like and laugh at, rather than anything inspiring real-life organizing that matters. For example 50501, a group organizing nationwide protests, including on March 4 in Indiana. A small crew of tough-talking liberals isnt going to stop the GOP from making trans citizens daily experience a living hell, deporting tens of thousands of people, and slashing federal aid. Woke is such a stained word, its difficult to imagine anyone seriously rallying around it. The cutthroat dark MAGA has succeeded in part because that bigotry and violence was always lurking under the surface, among the racist forum dwellers and citizen militias and white supremacist influencers. There isnt an equivalent dark woke ecosystem on the left. Without a critical mass of current Democrat politicians practicing dark woke-ism, the whole thing just feels like a LARP, a pathetic consolation prize for losing the election. Its fan-ficfun but not real. If the Democrats do with dark woke what they did with Dark Brandon and BRATadopt it as a marketing exercise, a tactic to signal edginess without real follow-throughit wont help them win elections. What the politicians really need to do is passionately spar with their opponents and rally around daring policy ideas that amp up progressives and everyday people. They need to have sincere convictions and put their careers on the line, to do things that terrify the GOP. They need to quit confusing inaction with civility, but find something other than insults and nebulous fantasies of cruelty to replace it. Dark woke is a rebrand. We need a new idea. Michael B.

If the menswear at last years Oscars was truly just Ken, were grateful the fellas this year showed up with a little moreSubstance. On Sunday night, the biggest red-carpet stars at the 97th Academy Awards were also some of the biggest stars of the whole shebang. Three actors in competitionColman Domingo, Timothée Chalamet, and Jeremy Stronghappened to be dogged fashion plates, and thus were all but guaranteed to pull up in envelope-pushing ensembles. But even their fellow nominees, Sebastian Stan and Ralph Fiennes, cranked up the volume on their standard black tuxedos. Heavy on the straight-off-the-runway designer garms, timeless British tailoring, and more than a few swing-for-the-fences swerves, it all added up to one of the more exciting menswear spectacles in recent Oscar memory. Here are the 11 best-dressed men from the 2025 Academy Awards, definitively ranked. Still the number-one boy in our hearts, best supporting actor nominee Jeremy Strong hit the Oscars carpet in his signature huebrownby way of a taut, cortado-toned tuxedo with sharp lapels and a matching criss-crossed bow tie. The tux hailed from Loro Piana, the Italian luxury brand with whom Strong has maintained a close relationship since his Succession days. Loro Piana also made Kendall Roys most notorious accessory a 625 logoless cashmere baseball cap. Anyways, props to Strong for continuing to incorporate his signature quirks into just about any genre of formalwear. Tuxedo by Loro Piana. As per usual, a handful of fellas attempted the all-black-everything looka move with a higher degree of difficulty than you might think, because its tough to pull off without looking like a Vegas nightclub bouncer. Our guy Samuel L. managed to sidestep that issue by way of an elegant Giorgio Armani notch-lapel tuxedounderstated save for a touch of festive sequins along the interior edges of the jacket and down the seams of the trouserspaired with a crisp Mandarin-collar shirt and some textbook, right-on-trend accountant glasses. The only thing missing? One of his signature backwards Kangols, which wouldve rocketed him up this list by at least a couple of spots. Suit by Giorgio Armani. Speaking of all-black-everything and Mandarin collars Pope, a Broadway fixture and recent Calvin Klein model, opted for a silky smooth Balmain ensemble that, between its graceful Tang suit silhouette and louche flared bottoms, looked very much like something Bruce Lee wouldve worn in his swaggering 70s heyday. And while the whole bow motif thing might seem a touch tired in womenswear these days, swapping em in here on the jacket in place of the typical Chinese frog fasteners felt fresh and inspired. Suit by Balmain. Dig through the GQ.com archives for any length of time, and youll find no shortage of photos of a young Mick Jagger looking stylish as all hell prepped up in a classic striped rugby in 1964 splayed out on stage in a trim cricket jumper and Repettos a year later getting married in St. Tropez in a rip-roaring three-piece and beat-to-shit canvas kicks in the early 70s. So it was nice to see that at 81, Jagger still possesses the righteous verve that everyone from Harry Styles to Hedi Slimane continues to emulate todayeven if the Stones frontman did have to trade his iconic heeled Cuban boots for a more sensible pair of Nike runners with his glittery pinstripe suit. We mean it as a total compliment when we say What a perfectly weird suit for a perfectly weird guy. Hollywoods newest sweetheart, Mark Eydelshteynone of the many breakout stars from the big winner of the night, Sean Bakers Anoralooked great in his wonky double-breasted tuxedo by Balenciaga. The tux had great movement, which suited Eydelshteyn as he goofed around on the red carpet. A good sartorial precursor to the Anora team spending the rest of their evening dancing their faces off to t.A.T.u.s 2002 hit All The Things She Said. Tuxedo by Balenciaga Couture. Wicked costumer Paul Tazewell made history at last nights ceremony, becoming the first Black man to win the Oscar for best costume design. We like to think that his victory was at least partly thanks to his dripped-out vision for the films CGI goat professor, Dr. Dillamond. He took to the stage in a fantastical custom tuxedo and an Oz-green watch, which lent a nice blend of old-school formality and whimsywhich were also two of the most winning qualities of his Wicked costume designto the nights menswear milieu. And what a cool move that, at the afterparty, Tazewell unfurled his ribbon collar while he held his Oscar statuette high. As he should! Tuxedo by Dolce  Gabbana. Shoes by Bottega Veneta. Watch by IWC. Jewelry by Fred Leighton. Savile Row heads, this ones for you. Fiennes, ever the consummate Briton, turned to one of Londons most exciting young bespoke houses for his Oscars night look. Taillour, the brainchild of Timothy Everest vets Lee Rekert and Fred Nieddu, fashioned a tuxedo for the Conclave star in their signature uber-wide-lapelled cut. The garment draped across his figure immaculately, as you might imagine, a point that Fiennes drove home by displaying his spry physicality on the red carpet. A white-edged bow tie added the faintest touch of rebellious flourish to an otherwise classic rig executed to perfection. Suit by Taillour. Shoes by Manolo Blahnik. Colman Domingos red-carpet fashion has become its own awards-season spectator sport, and he is always his own best competition. At Sundays Oscars, the best actor nominee wore a lipstick-red Valentino tuxedo jacket with contrasting black lapels and a fringed sash tied at the waist, which he accessorized with a pair of rose-tinted glasses. No matter how the awards went, Domingos was an outfit fit for celebratingand its no wonder that he started a party in the room during the commercial break. Tuxedo by Valentino. Watch by Omega. Jewelry by Boucheron. Well miss the freaky fever dream that was Timothée Chalamets A Complete Unknown press tour, but something tells me the now twice-thwarted best actor nominee will have something new up his sleeve in no time. It seems Chalamet and his stylist, Taylor McNeill, reached some sort of sartorial mind-meld over the past several months, as proven by this heater of a margarine-yellow leather suit designed by Givenchys incoming creative director Sarah Burton, which featured the inspired pairing of a cropped tuxedo jacket and snug trousers that fit like jeans. It was the most-discussed look of the night for good reason, even if it probably stung a little extra to have to gamely lose your category while dressed like a stick of butter. Suit by Givenchy. Watch and jewelry by Cartier. Pop star Omar Apollo, who appeared in the Oscar-snubbed Luca Guadagnino film Queer, was the menswear maximalist of the evening. But theres a reason why you sometimes just want it with the works The fishnet veil with the goatee and braids the flared pants with the bow-dotted ballet flats the polka-dot shirt with the fringed scarf where a tie should be. Weve had it with these Hollywood guys throwing on a single brooch and calling it a day though, of course, Apollo had one of those on, too. When the vibe is right, more certainly is more. Suit by Valentino. Veil by Binata Millinery. Jewelry by Chopard. This is it, folks the nexus of traditional, Old Hollywood black-tie and radical, New Hollywood high-fashion. Designed expressly for the best-actor nominee by taste gods Miuccia Prada and Raf Simons, Stans Prada tuxedo trulyas Stefon might put ithad everything swooping, elongated shawl lapels a flatteringly broad cummerbund razor-sharp, full-legged trousers and a right-on-time pair of gleaming square-toe shoes. But the pièce de résistance, the reason this look landed in the number-one spot, is the shirt. The wide, crepey pleats and soft winged collar are on their own winsome spins on tuxedo-shirt hallmarks paired with that creamy ecru tone, however, it elevates the whole endeavor to a hall-of-fame-worthy Oscar-night kit.

The best carry-on backpacks have an big impact on our overall travel comfort Pick the wrong one and youll end up hauling what feels like an oversized load through a never-ending airport terminal. Compound that with strict airline regulations that only allow for backpacks that can fit under the seat in front of you or in the overhead bin, and suddenly, finding the best carry-on pack can feel like a tall order. Thats why we tested a grip of the best technical and fashionable carry-on backpacks for every kind of traveler, from aesthetic objets dart to carry-on travel backpacks that look as good in the TSA line as they do in a meeting or on the trail.

Peak Design Peak Design Planning a trip is stressful enough, so packing the bag should be the easy part. Right? If only all bag companies took a cue from Peak Designs playbook, because its Travel Backpack is the ideal companion for all journeys short and long. This 45-liter bag has a black-hole-like interior, where organization and ease of access take precedence so that packing and unpacking your bag is a breeze. Ingenious storage solutionslike hidden exterior storage straps and zippered pockets throughout the inside and outside of the bagmight get you confused as to where exactly you put that travel adapter, but thats a minor complaint for all the ways you can optimize the storage to bring literally everything you want and need. The biggest selling point of this bag is that despite its massive size, you can compress it to be a 35-liter bag so its more convenient to tote on the daily. Either way, youll have no issue getting this on your plane without having to argue with TSA about it passing the carry-on size requirements. Jansport Amazon Jansport, the brand of backpack you probably carried in high school, recently released a carry-on-sized backpack thats graduated from carrying pencils and a couple textbooks. The Venture Pack is a hefty backpack with one large main compartment, which fully opens for ease of access. We like that theres a laptop sleeve thats designed to sit closer to the wearers back so it feels more secure, making it harder for pickpockets to access if youre too busy burying your head in Google Maps. Compression straps are great for overpackers who like to squeeze as much air out of their goods as possible so that the pack can actually squeeze into that overhead bin. For wearability, the bag features a perimeter wireframe suspension system and an adjustable torso length so that your stuff doesnt feel as heavy once youre strapped in. Additionally, you can buy the separate Venture Daypack, which buckles into the Venture Pack so that you can carry double the load one on your back and one at the front. Is it a good look? Well, its a look, and youll increase just how much stuff you can carry. Topo Designs Topo Designs Clearly youre looking for a carry-on to wear as a backpack, but say your back is killing you one day. Maybe you want a backpack that can also be shoulder bag. Hell, what if it were sort of a duffel too? The Topo Designs Global Travel Bag can be held those three ways to accommodate your travel style, but above all else, its a great way to get from point A to point B with all of your stuff and anymore things you might gather along the way. The main compartment has a zipper that opens all the way so you can get to your things more easily without blindly rummaging through your belongings to find something. Another not-as-large compartment holds flatter items, which can be easily organized into neat little zippered pocket. To get the most out of your Global Travel Bag, get the brands packing cubes to maximize the already-large space. Aer Aer If your bags already heavy and you still need to back a weeks worth of gear in there, well, your chiropractors going to be busy in a couple weeks. Luckily, Aers lightweight Travel Pack 3 clocks in at just a tad over four pounds so you can load it up with all the clothes you can humanly imagine bringing on your trip, just shy of packing your whole dresser. A bevy of zippered pockets around the exterior of the bag means your phone, passport, boarding pass, etc. have a dedicated home so that they can easily be accessed amid the chaos of going to your destination via plane, train, or automobile. Compression straps mean you can cram just a tad extra into this slightly small bag, but above all else, youll be able to hoof it with your backpack without having to schedule a post-vacation spinal realignment session. Yeti Yeti What does a brand that makes coolers and insulated tumblers know about bags? Apparently a lot, because Yetis recently released like, yesterday Ranchero has all the makings for your next favorite travel bag. The 27-liter Ranchero also available in a smaller 20-liter option has a Y-shaped opening that makes getting into the thing a breeze, especially if you need something that would be at the bottom of the pack. The dual buckled exterior act as compression straps, as well as extra storage, say if you want to attach your jacket to the outside of the bag. I love the way the bag opens completely, GQs senior commerce editor Ian Burke says. Ive tested a lot of bags in my day, but this Y-shaped opening is a new one for me. It makes it super easy to pack bulkier items like shoes or gym gear without having to blindly stuff them in. The big water bottle pouches are a nice touch, too. Like any good travel companion, there are loads of zippers, pouches, and pockets, so you dont have to make like your dad and wear cargo pants through the TSA. Alo Alo Small but mighty, the Alo Stow Backpack has a matte neoprene shell which aside from being water-resistant makes the pack soft and malleable while always keeping its shapeeven when Im cramming it in between seats. I like that its chunky, jam-free zippers allow me to grab it and open compartments from any angle, too. While other backpack straps have a way of twisting and feeling like daggers cutting into my shoulders, Alo figured out the delicate balance of having lightweight straps that can support up to 75 pounds of weight against my back while staying firmly in place. The roomy main compartment, two exterior zipper pockets, water bottle pouch, interior pocket, and laptop sleeve that can fit my entire packing list just sweeten the deal. Calpak Calpak The torture of a long-haul flight is usually followed up by what feels like equally long Uber wait timeswhich can make even the lightest of backpacks start to feel heavy. Thankfully, the CalPak Terra 26Ls best feature is that it easily converts from backpack to duffel in under five seconds, making it a pleasure to stand in line with. Its adjustable shoulder straps are also detachable for even more versatility. But perhaps its most impressive feature is the compression straps with buckles that keep anything important or fragile from shifting around inside. Made from recycled ripstop polyester, it also sports a 17 laptop sleeve and comes with a bonus sling bag. Rains Rains Ive been a fan of Rains since I first acquired their waterproof read basically floodproof backpack, which I still use to this day. Im equally infatuated with their Rolltop Rucksack Minimalist, refined, durable, and with black-hole-levels of storage, this bags sensibly sized dimensions allow for easy storage under an airline seat or in the overhead bin. The rolled top secures with a lobster clasp to make sure I can tightly squeeze in all of my chargers and gear or let things breathe a little if Im simply packing a hoodie or two. I also thoroughly enjoy the side pockets which ensure Im able to slip in everything from my earbuds to a pack of gum with ease. Plus, theres a two-year warranty should anything happen to your pack. Lululemon Lululemon As a frequent traveler, storage is a huge priority for me, and when I found this high-quality backpack from Lululemon in a retro-fun style, I immediately had to have it. The Lululemon Cruiser has a pocket for everything and then some, from the external hard shell case that protects my favorite sunnies to the quick-access side and front pockets where I stash toiletries and travel-sized packets of Morning Kick the Chuck Norris-approved digestion aid I swear by to combat fatigue, travelers tummy and jet lag on trips. Despite being so slim, this bag had a solid amount of padding meant for laptop protection and a strap to slip it right onto your rolling bag. I also love that the poly-nylon fabric is water-repellent and made to keep everything safe even when I inevitably spill my inflight drink. First of all, you need to be able to, well, carry on your carry-on bagwhich means its got to be small enough to squeeze by airline restrictions youre generally safe with anything 40L or smaller. A true goldilocks carry-on luggage pick features multiple pockets and compartments, is comfortable enough to lug through an airport, and looks good enough to make us feel stylish even on the most brutal of travel days. Bonus points for extras including packing cubes, hip belts, water bottle storage, laptop sleeves, water resistance, and easy-access compartments. Most importantly, make sure to pick the carry-on backpack that works best for youi.e., dont just snag the first pack you find on Amazon without making sure it addresses your specific travel needs. GQ has been testing and reviewing mens backpacks for years, and were currently conducting in-depth testing on the top carry-on travel packs. Well continue to update our selections in this guide as we pack, carry on, and rack up air miles with these bags. When evaluating the best travel backpacks and carry-on backpacks, we first consider durability. Does the bag have durable fabric, internal frames, or waterproofing? Next, we consider how much travel gear can be stored inside. Access is also important, and we check to see how easily we can reach our items from the various pockets and compartments. When we go hands-on, we load up the backpacks with gear and other personal items to see how comfortable they are during long walks. We hate back sweat as much as any traveler, and were looking for bags with generous and comfy padding in all the right places. Finally, we check to see how much wear and tear the bag sustains. Whenever possible, we used the bags as carry-ons during air travel to see how travel-friendly and carry-on size they really are. Since this is GQ, theres one final test the fit test. We want to see which bags earn unsolicited compliments and look best on our backs. Call us vain if you like, but we believe looking your best is a sign of self-respect and its own reward.
