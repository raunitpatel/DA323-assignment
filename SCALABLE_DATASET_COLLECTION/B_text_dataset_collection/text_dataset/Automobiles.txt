Our Lightning Lap hotshoes sit down with deputy video editor Carlos Lago to discuss the cars, the laps, and all the lessons they learned along the way. If you happened to be inside one of the cars at this years Lightning Lap while our editors were hard at work setting times, you wouldnt hear much of anything beyond tires squealing and engines roaring. Having a conversation at speed isnt ideal, so thats what these commentary videos are for. You get to hear about the cars, the laps, and all sorts of Lightning Lap fun facts from the editors who went out there and put down the times. This year, weve put all five videosfour from our editors, and one from special guest driver Romain Dumasin one convenient location. Throw on your HANS device and strap in. Mazda MX-5 Miata Club This was technical editor Austin Irwins first year setting timed laps, and his enthusiasm is hard to hide. You might not think of the Mazda Miata as a make-or-break kind of car, but for Irwin, the pressure to set a blazing time was pretty high. The ND3s low curb weight, approachable power, and easy limits made it a great dance partner around the Grand Course configuration. See if you can catch the little giggle the camera picks up just before the three-minute mark. Subaru BRZ tS  Subaru WRX tS  Hyundai Elantra N  Hyundai Ioniq 5 N Rich Ceppos isnt just the director of our hallowed Buyers Guidehes also a driver with decades of track-hustling experience. And you can hear that experience in his rundowns well never get tired of listening to him dive deep into the minutiae of braking zones and how to squeeze every tenth out of a car, whether its brimming with horsepower or not. Stick around for the end of the video, where he digs into the trickiness of the Ioniq 5 Ns myriad vehicle settings. Bentley Continental GT Speed  Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing  Porsche Taycan Turbo GT  Lucid Air Sapphire Now were getting to the real spicy stuff. Testing director Dave VanderWerp was supposed to avoid gas cars entirely this year, but due to some last-minute staff kerfuffles, he ended up splitting his time between gas drinkers and EVs. If youve ever wondered about the intricacies inherent in slapping a Bentley around a track as quickly as possible, or how the CT5-V Blackwings new Precision pack feels in practice, or how to actually get all the power out of the Taycan Turbo GT, your answers lie in the video above. Mercedes-AMG GT63  McLaren Artura Spider  Lamborghini Revuelto  Porsche 718 Cayman GT4 RS Manthey Racing The trick to getting Dave Beard to set a blistering lap time is simple Tell him theres a grilled cheese in it for him at the end. Even if there isnt, hell still make the magic happen, despite staring down some of the most menacing metal at VIR this past year. Dive in and find out why the Lamborghini Revueltos insane power delivery turned the front straightaway into a whole nother corner. Ford Performance F-150 Lightning SuperTruck Pickup trucks come to Lightning Lap to do anything other than set lap times. But not the Ford Performance F-150 Lightning SuperTruck. Riding atop four electric motors making 2200 horsepower is a feat for no mere mortal. Thankfully, Romain Dumas is no mere mortal. The French racing driver joins us to discuss the truck and the utterly bewildering lap time he set with it. Were still trying to wrap our brains around it.

Take a closer look at the team and machines that orchestrate our annual track test at Virginia International Raceway. Youve heard the expression, It takes a village. This is the 18th year weve made the trek from our editorial headquarters in Ann Arbor, Michigan for a week of fast lap times around the 4.1-mile Grand Course at Virginia International Raceway. This year, we entered 13 performance cars into the gauntlet. Nobody wants to work from home during Lightning Lap, and it takes a lot of GoPros, lap timers, tires, and snacks to get the job done. Heres a look at the people and machines behind the scenes of this years annual track test. BACK TO LIGHTNING LAP 2025 Each car has a checklist before it leaves the paddock There are two GoPros mounted to each vehicle to capture every curb-eating attempt at a good time. Although the quickest laps are completed in just a few minutes, after three track days, there are terabytes of footage. The 771-hp Bentley Continental GT Speed suckling from the teat of VIRs electrical grid. Pit lane runs parallel to VIRs front straightaway. Automakers who send engineers and PR folks use the stairwell from the paddock garage above to get to the pits, where they will often adjust tire pressures and run a stopwatch of their own. Our social media team worked feverishly to answer every question posted by our Instagram followers. If youre a grilled-cheese sandwich and managing testing editor David Beard is giving you this look run. Our video and photo crew work out of the same paddock garages IMSAs race teams do. Sometimes, there is tape left on the concrete from engineers of race weekends past. This year, we found a green dinosaur sticker from AO Racings Rexy Porsche 911 GT3 team. Fitting, because there was no shortage of green cars this year. Photographers are required to wear a harness while strapped into the photo vehicle during car-to-car photography. Its there to prevent them from accidentally falling out. But if staff photographer Marc Urbano wants to wear it casually as a fashion accessory, we wont stop him. Associate testing editor Gannon Burgett left and video editor Alex Malburg right have mounted enough GoPros to Lightning Lap cars to know that putting the camera on the roofand out of the travel of the windshield wipersis the right way to do it. Theres more than 6500 horsepower among the cars in this image. And thats without including the 266-hp Subaru Ascent rental car in the background. The 276-hp Hyundai Elantra N rests on a set of QuickJack portable car lifts as it awaits a new set of rubber. Editor-in-chief Tony Quiroga refers to Lightning Lap as employee retention week. Just before technical editor Austin Irwin was about to pursue his dream of becoming the worlds greatest and potentially largest tap dancer, the opportunity to set a hot lap steered him back. Yet, he still got to dance. That moment when someone says, Lunch is ready. If Guys Being Dudes were a band, this would be the album cover. Buyers Guide director Rich Ceppos has spent a lifetime in cars. He competed in the 24 Hours of Daytona in 1987. He wrote the tested review of the 400,000 Ferrari F40 in 1991. And hes had his name on the Car and Driver masthead for more than 20 years. What does a guy like Rich think about when hes waiting to set a fast lap in fast cars? Did I really lock my hotel key in my room?! We use toy cars to help set up and practice the giant group shot for the magazine cover. Not even joking, thats how we do it. Road warrior Jacob Kurowicki cheeses for the camera after forcefully declaring, Cars are more exciting on two wheels, damn it! Editor-in-chief Tony Quirogas first Lightning Lap was in 2008. Then, he set a time in a Chevrolet Cobalt SS. Today, hes helping a new driver get up to speed around VIRs daunting road course. Towers of Pirelli P Zero Trofeo RS tires waiting to be scrubbed beneath the 5319-pound Lucid Air Sapphire. There are 24 turns to tackle within VIRs Grand Course layout. They lay within five sectors and have names like NASCAR Bend, Climbing Esses, Oak Tree, Bitch, and Roller Coaster. Getting a car through each of these without a mistake can be nerve-racking. 2024 Lamborghini Revuelto at Lightning Lap 2025 2025 McLaren Artura Spider at Lightning Lap 2025 2025 Porsche Taycan Turbo GT at Lightning Lap 2025 2025 Subaru WRX tS at Lightning Lap 2025 Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing at Lightning Lap 2025 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5 N at Lightning Lap 2025 Lightning Lap 2025 Bentley Continental GT Speed - Lightning Lap 2025 2024 Mazda MX-5 Miata Club at Lightning Lap 2025 2024 Subaru BRZ tS at Lightning Lap 2025 2024 Hyundai Elantra N at Lightning Lap 2025 2024 Mercedes-AMG GT63 at Lightning Lap 2025 A Part of Hearst Digital Media We may earn a commission for purchases made through our links. 2025 Hearst Autos, Inc.

A small turbo four replaces the twin-turbo V-6, but the endearing playfulness remains. Some cars tell you what theyre all about the moment you wake them up. The Mercedes-AMG GLC43 Coupe comes to life with the snarl of a happy puppy wanting to play. And what you hear is what you get a feisty, fun-loving compact SUV that nips at your inner enthusiast. Its always ready to romp but is never vicious. The 416-hp GLC43 Coupe is the underdog to the overdog GLC63 S E Performance Coupe plug-in hybrid, which pounds out a combined 671 horses between its gas engine and electric motor. But dont be fooled by the 255-hp difference between these two the GLC43 is lovable in its own right. Its M139l turbocharged four-cylinder is shared with the GLC63, and even here, the turbo four makes an impressive 416 horsepower, or 208 horsepower per liter. In the GLC63 it belts out 469 horsepower, a mega number for such a small engine. Both engines employ Mercedess Formula 1inspired electrically assisted turbocharger, which is intended to help the turbo spin up faster, mitigating boost lag and improving throttle response at lower revs. The GLC43s belt-driven starter-generator also adds 13 horsepower at low revs for the same purpose, though its not factored into the engines overall output. The turbo four channels its power through AMGs nine-speed automatic, which substitutes a wet clutch for a torque converter. The standard all-wheel-drive system is rear-biased, permanently splitting torque 31 percent front, 69 percent rear. In comparison to the GLC63s Rube Goldberg powertraina 4.8-kWh battery, two electric motors, and a two-speed gearbox for the rear-axle motorthe 43s setup seems from a simpler time. But less is also more Absent the 63s mother lode of plug-in-hybrid hardware, the 43s curb weight should be considerably lighter, though we havent been able to weigh either model. Its far less complex to boot. This is a good parts list, but in the end, the magic comes from how the engineers meld the pieces to work together. In the GLC43, it all clicks. This sporty SUV is a happy companion in almost every situation. The playful snarl on start-up lingers in the background as a constant presence that makes even modest acceleration sound exciting, let alone rips to the 7000-rpm redline. Thankfully, the raspy exhaust note quiets down to a distant hum during interstate cruising. Still, if you like your performance cars to speak in their indoor voice, this is not the one for you. The current models 2.0-liter four replaced the twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6 that resided under the GLC43s hood through 2023. It delivers 31 more horsepower but loses 15 pound-feet of torque. We expect its 60-mph time to land around four seconds. Despite the electrified turbo and motor-generator assistance, theres still some lag below 2500 rpm it takes a couple of beats for the engine to gather itself up when you push deep into the throttle. This dearth of low-end torque is exacerbated off the line by the transmissions wet clutch. It engages fluidly, but the take-up happens so slowly that moving off from a stoplight feels like driving through a vat of molasses until youre across the intersection. From that point, the power swells and the GLC43 surges ahead like a Jack Russell chasing a squirrel. Sadly, shaving two cylinders and one liter of displacement from the GLC43 Coupes engine barely changes the overall fuel economy. The turbo fours 18-mpg EPA city number is but 1 mpg better than the previous V-6s, while its 24-mpg highway rating is unchanged. Wed wondered whether wed like the turbocharged four-cylinder as much as the sonorous twin turbo V-6, and the answer is yes. Its not better, though, just different. Beyond the powertrain, AMG buttresses the GLC43s chassis with adaptive dampers and speed-dependent four-wheel steering. Summer tires, size 26545R-20 front and 29540R-20 rear as standard, promise ample cornering grip. The GLC43 drives cohesively, with direct steering, sharp brakes, and a taut ride that never gets harsheven in Sport mode. It feels wide awake and ready to cut sharply into bends, even on the winter tires our test car was fitted with, but it settles down comfortably on the highway. Its never boring and always playful, even on trips to the supermarket. And if you want this formulation in a more conventional SUV profile, its also available in the squareback GLC SUV body style. This being an AMG, the GLC43 Coupe is both well dressed and well equipped at its 71,750 base price. It uses Benzs crisply rendered, multilayered MBUX infotainment system, which is sometimes cumbersome to navigate through. As with other AMG products, its easy to inflate the MSRP with all manner of goodies that dont alter the GLC43s core driving character. Our test car had more than 11,000 of those options special paint, leather and carbon-fiber interior trim, a Burmester Surround Sound system, additional safety gear, black 21-inch AMG Y-spoke wheels up from the standard 20s, dynamic engine mounts, AMGs Track Pace performance video-and-data recorder, and more. Had they all been absent, it wouldnt have changed how the GLC43 drives, or how we feel about it. The best cars are more than the sum of their parts, and the GLC43 manages to be exactly that. It offers a surprising and rewarding balance of capability and fun, with a side of SUV-ish practicalitya car thats ready to play whenever you are. Kind of like a happy puppy. And everyone loves puppies, dont they?

The MC20 rocketed down the Kennedy Space Center runway at over 197 mph, all without a human driver on board. Maseratis MC20 supercar racked up a fair bit of acclaim when it launched back in 2021, but now, its entered the record books for an unexpected reason the MC20 has become the worlds fastest autonomous vehicle. Piloted solely by artificial intelligence driver software, the car hit a top speed of 197.7 mph  4.9 mph faster than any self-driving car has ever gone before. The record-breaking feat was done at the Space Florida Launch and Landing Facility, a.k.a. the LLF, located at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. At 2.8 miles in length, the LLF has one of the longest runways in the world, which makes it the perfect place to test top speed runs. Just ask John Hennessey. Hence why the Indy Autonomous Challenge, or IAC, chose the LLF for the site of this top speed challenge, which was a collaboration with Italian university Politecnico di Milano, Maserati and the 1000 Miglia Experience Florida. These world speed records are much more than just a showcase of future technology we are pushing AI-driver software and robotics hardware to the absolute edge, Paul Mitchell, CEO of IAC, said in a statement. Doing so with a streetcar is helping transition the learnings of autonomous racing to enable safe, secure, sustainable, high-speed autonomous mobility on highways. The Maserati MC20 Coupe is powered by a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V-6 that makes 621 horsepower. According to the carmaker, the top speed of the car with a human driver on board is 202 mph. The fact that an AI-powered robo-driver got so close to the top speed of the MC20 Coupe is a rather staggering achievement. A Maserati MC20 Cielo convertible was also on hand, joining in the convoy of cars taking part in the 1000 Miglia Experience Florida rally. This particular example was otablen because its the same car drove in the 2023 edition of the historical 1000 Miglia race in Italy, where it traveled approximately 60 kilometers about 37 miles in autonomous mode. Autonomous driving on a flat, straight, empty runway is one thing navigating public roads is something else entirely. Either way, that technology seems to be getting closer to production every single day. That said, the thrill of a Maserati comes from actually driving it, right? 2026 Audi A6 Avant Wagon Every Angle Audis Newest A6 Avant Station Wagon Is Here Ford Maverick Faces Double Recall Over Old Repairs Trump Imposes 25 Tariffs on Canada and Mexico New Bentley CEO EV Transition Date Isnt Fixed The Corvette SS Sets Record with 7.7 Million Sale Is the Best BMW Museum Actually on Your Phone?

The Taycan Turbo S has a starring role in this new action movie. Heres how it got the job done. Den of Thieves 2 Pantera doesnt have a De Tomaso mid-engine sports car in it. Bummer. But there is a Porsche Taycan Turbo, and thats a plus. Actually, there were five Taycans. This is the sequel to 2018s Den of Thieves and brings back stars Gerard Butler and OShea Jackson, Jr. to answer all the questions of character motivation and plot holes left behind by that first movie. And then it creates new questions about character motivation and new plot holes. Like the first, its all set around a heist. And like the first, its as much about male bonding and the struggle between good and evil as it is about stealing stuff. Theres lots of gunplay, plenty of words not commonly used here, clenched jaws, Marlboros, and beard stubble. Its not quite clear whether the Pantera part of the title refers to the criminals or the cops. And that messy ambivalence may be the point. The Taycan looks great. Shot like it was a Playboy centerfold. Better than Glamour-Shots-at-the-mall lustrous. It is the getaway vehicle after the big diamond heist and does things that Porsche Taycans arent supposed to do. Porsche supplied five Taycans to the production to portray the one car. All were factory development vehicles for the Turbo S model and were shipped to Tenerife in the Canary Islands where the films climactic chase was shot. All five were never destined to be sold to the public. The first Taycan was a stock and unmodified Turbo S used to portray the getaway machine in hero shots. Those are the shots where the vehicle is pristine and dazzling. Its the car thats seen with the actors outside of it. A second Taycan Turbo S was used as a pod car. Thats a vehicle thats been modified with a driving pod attached to its roof like the one at the top of this story. A stunt driver in the lofty pod is piloting the vehicle while the actors are emoting and reacting and doing all sorts of action stuff in the cockpit. All of the driving control components, including the instrument cluster, ignition, sport response dial, shiftergear selector, steering wheel, accelerator, brake, and stunt drift brake were moved to the roof of the car and mounted in the driving pod, explains Porsche spokesperson Jarred Hopkins. The steering was converted to hydraulic, because there wasnt enough room to relocate the steering column to the roof of the pod. According to the films producers, this was the first time an all-electric car was outfitted with a remote-driving pod for filming. However, driving pods have become common tools for shooting car chases. At least common for productions that can afford them. A third Taycan was gutted and used as a biscuit rig vehicle. Essentially, all the things that identify a Taycan as a Taycanthe body, the interior, and most of the sheet metalare mounted to a mobile camera platform that acts as the Taycans chassis. So, in a way, this was a Taycan powered by an internal combustion engine. This allows cameras to peer into the Taycan and capture the actors at work inside. The fourth and fifth Taycans were stunt cars modified by Porsche to do many silly things. The changes were a mix of software and mechanical, Hopkins says. One of the more daunting requests was that the car had to be able to travel in reverse at up to nearly 60 mph, which required significant software overrides. Connected to this was a hydraulic handbrake, which was used liberally and with dramatic effect! Movie car mechanics can work miracles, but the Taycan is one of the worlds most technologically complex vehicles. So, Porsche did most of the modifications on the stunt cars itself. And Porsche had its own personnel on hand during filming. Porsche also says that the cars were charged on Tenerife using Porsches consumer charging stations. Porsche lists the consumer wall chargers at a modest very modest for Porsche 1670 on its website. This is, after all, the company that charges 6220 for the LeatherRace-Tex Interior in Black with Shark Blue Stitching option on its GT3. For anyone who likes action movies, Den of Thieves 2 is a solid one. Director Gudegast also wrote the screenplay and knows how to move a camera effectively. Gerard Butler is Scottish, but plays a Los Angeles cop well, and OShea Jackson, Jr. has a true straight-from-Hawthorne authenticity. Most of the action is set in France, instead of the originals Southern California though largely filmed in Atlanta. Incidentally, in conversation at Californias Porsche Experience Center, both actors admitted that their daily drivers are Range Rovers. And both deny ever hurling while shooting the action scenes. As for the film itself, the plot is too torturous and drawn out. The twist ending isnt that much of a surprise. The characters often come across as archetypes instead of human beings. And diamonds seem like a slightly outdated heist object now that gem-quality ones are made in labs. Plus, the heist itself is awfully dangerous. Wouldnt have been easier just to do a smash-and-grab at the Zales in Culver City? All that aside, however, its fun to watch athletic stunt performers doing athletic things before they die gruesome on-screen deaths. As far as heist films go, this one is a notch behind 2011s Fast Five, but superior to all the subsequent Fast  Furious films. The gold standard remains Michael Manns 1995 classic Heat. Incidentally, Den of Thieves 2s director is the son of actor Eric Braeden. And Braedens long resume includes a villain turn as Bruno Von Sickle in that 1977 car culture phenom, Herbie Goes To Monte Carlo.
