AI News is part of the TechForge Publications series TechForge Artificial Intelligence, Development, Ethics  Society, Legislation  Government Ryan Daws February 26, 2025 Share this story Tags Categories EU-funded initiative CERTAIN aims to drive ethical AI compliance in Europe amid increasing regulations like the EU AI Act. CERTAIN  short for Certification for Ethical and Regulatory Transparency in Artificial Intelligence  will focus on the development of tools and frameworks that promote transparency, compliance, and sustainability in AI technologies. The project is led by Idemia Identity  Security France in collaboration with 19 partners across ten European countries, including the St. Pölten University of Applied Sciences UAS in Austria. With its official launch in January 2025, CERTAIN could serve as a blueprint for global AI governance. According to Sebastian Neumaier, Senior Researcher at the St. Pölten UAS Institute of IT Security Research and project manager for CERTAIN, the goal is to address crucial regulatory and ethical challenges. In CERTAIN, we want to develop tools that make AI systems transparent and verifiable in accordance with the requirements of the EUs AI Act. Our goal is to develop practically feasible solutions that help companies to efficiently fulfil regulatory requirements and sustainably strengthen confidence in AI technologies, emphasised Neumaier. To achieve this, CERTAIN aims to create user-friendly tools and guidelines that simplify even the most complex AI regulationshelping organisations both in the public and private sectors navigate and implement these rules effectively. The overall intent is to provide a bridge between regulation and innovation, empowering businesses to leverage AI responsibly while fostering public trust. One of CERTAINs primary objectives is to establish consistent standards for data sharing and AI development across Europe. By setting industry-wide norms for interoperability, the project seeks to improve collaboration and efficiency in the use of AI-driven technologies. The effort to harmonise data practices isnt just limited to compliance it also aims to unlock new opportunities for innovation. CERTAINs solutions will create open and trustworthy European data spacesessential components for driving sustainable economic growth. In line with the EUs Green Deal, CERTAIN places a strong focus on sustainability. AI technologies, while transformative, come with significant environmental challengessuch as high energy consumption and resource-intensive data processing. CERTAIN will address these issues by promoting energy-efficient AI systems and advocating for eco-friendly methods of data management. This dual approach not only aligns with EU sustainability goals but also ensures that AI development is carried out with the health of the planet in mind. A unique aspect of CERTAIN is its approach to fostering collaboration and dialogue among stakeholders. The project team at St. Pölten UAS is actively engaging with researchers, tech companies, policymakers, and end-users to co-develop, test, and refine ideas, tools, and standards. This practice-oriented exchange extends beyond product development. CERTAIN also serves as a central authority for informing stakeholders about legal, ethical, and technical matters related to AI and certification. By maintaining open channels of communication, CERTAIN ensures that its outcomes are not only practical but also widely adopted. CERTAIN is part of the EUs Horizon Europe programme, specifically under Cluster 4 Digital, Industry, and Space. The projects multidisciplinary and international consortium includes leading academic institutions, industrial giants, and research organisations, making it a powerful collective effort to shape the future of AI in Europe. In January 2025, representatives from all 20 consortium members met in Osny, France, to kick off their collaborative mission. The two-day meeting set the tone for the projects ambitious agenda, with partners devising strategies for tackling the regulatory, technical, and ethical hurdles of AI. As the EUs AI Act edges closer to implementation, guidelines and tools like those developed under CERTAIN will be pivotal. The Act will impose strict requirements on AI systems, particularly those deemed high-risk, such as applications in healthcare, transportation, and law enforcement. While these regulations aim to ensure safety and accountability, they also pose challenges for organisations seeking to comply. CERTAIN seeks to alleviate these challenges by providing actionable solutions that align with Europes legal framework while encouraging innovation. By doing so, the project will play a critical role in positioning Europe as a global leader in ethical AI development.

AI News is part of the TechForge Publications series TechForge Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning AI News February 12, 2025 Share this story Tags Categories The advent of more powerful processors in the early 2000s started the computing revolution that led to what we now call the cloud. With single hardware instances able to run dozens, if not hundreds of virtual machines concurrently, businesses could offer their users multiple services and applications that would otherwise have been financially impractical, if not impossible. But virtual machines VMs have several downsides. Often, an entire virtualised operating system is overkill for many applications, and although very much more malleable, scalable, and agile than a fleet of bare-metal servers, VMs still require significantly more memory and processing power, and are less agile than the next evolution of this type of technology  containers. In addition to being more easily scaled up or down, according to demand, containerised applications consist of only the necessary parts of an application and its supporting dependencies. Therefore apps based on micro-services tend to be lighter and more easily configurable. Virtual machines exhibit the same security issues that affect their bare-metal counterparts, and to some extent, container security issues reflect those of their component parts a mySQL bug in a specific version of the upstream application will affect containerised versions too. With regards to VMs, bare metal installs, and containers, cybersecurity concerns and activities are very similar. But container deployments and their tooling bring specific security challenges to those charged with running apps and services, whether manually piecing together applications with choice containers, or running in production with orchestration at scale. According to Ari Weil at Akamai, Kubernetes is mature, but most companies and developers dont realise how complex  it can be until theyre actually at scale. The specific challenges of container security can be addressed using machine learning algorithms trained on observing the components of an application when its running clean. By creating a baseline of normal behaviour, machine learning can identify anomalies that could indicate potential threats from unusual traffic, unauthorised changes to configuration, odd user access patterns, and unexpected system calls. ML-based container security platforms can scan image repositories and compare each against databases of known vulnerabilities and issues. Scans can be automatically triggered and scheduled, helping prevent the addition of harmful elements during development and in production. Auto-generated audit reports can be tracked against standard benchmarks, or an organisation can set its own security standards  useful in environments where highly-sensitive data is processed. The connectivity between specialist container security functions and orchestration software means that suspected containers can be isolated or closed immediately, insecure permissions revoked, and user access suspended. With API connections to local firewalls and VPN endpoints, entire environments or subnets can be isolated, or traffic stopped at network borders. Machine learning can reduce the risk of data breach in containerised environments by working on several levels. Anomaly detection, asset scanning, and flagging potential misconfiguration are all possible, plus any degree of automated alerting or amelioration are relatively simple to enact. The transformative possibilities of container-based apps can be approached without the security issues that have stopped some from exploring, developing, and running microservice-based applications. The advantages of cloud-native technologies can be won without compromising existing security standards, even in high-risk sectors.
