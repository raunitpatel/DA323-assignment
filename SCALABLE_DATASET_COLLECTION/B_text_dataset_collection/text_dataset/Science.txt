Advertisement Drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy could raise the risk of a rare form of vision loss, but we are still trying to unpick why By Grace Wade 7 March 2025 Like all medicines, Ozempic is not without side effectsmyskinShutterstock Like all medicines, Ozempic is not without side effects myskinShutterstock Ozempic, Wegovy and similar drugs are, without a doubt, revolutionising medicine. They have transformed our ability to manage obesity and type 2 diabetes, but have actually shown potential for a wide range of conditions, such as Alzheimers disease, addiction and depression. Yet, as our understanding of the benefits of these drugs grows, so too does our knowledge about their potential side effects, one of which appears to be a rare type of vision loss called non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy NAION.

Advertisement NASAs newest space telescope will scan the entire sky in a range of near-infrared wavelengths to help astronomers better understand the evolution of the universe and search for promising spots for extraterrestrial life By Matthew Sparkes 28 February 2025 Artists impression of the SPHEREx space telescopeNASAJPL-Caltech Artists impression of the SPHEREx space telescope NASAJPL-Caltech The latest addition to NASAs fleet of space telescopes will launch this weekend and quickly set to work scanning the entire sky in a range of near-infrared wavelengths, collecting rich data on more than 450 million galaxies. The Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization, and Ices Explorer SPHEREx is due to launch on 2 March atop a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California at 10.09pm local time. Read moreWe are about to hear echoes in the fabric of space for the first time Read more We are about to hear echoes in the fabric of space for the first time Advertisement It carries a camera with a filter that splits incoming light like a prism and beams different portions of the spectrum onto 102 separate colour sensors. As the telescope pans around the sky, it slowly pieces together a complete image pixel by pixel. This strategy allows a relatively small and simple camera with no moving parts to do what might otherwise require a heavy and costly suite of sensors. If you scan the sky slowly by moving the telescope incrementally, then after enough time, every pixel in the sky will have been observed over a very wide wavelength range, giving you a crude spectrum of every bit of the sky, which has never been done before, says Richard Ellis at University College London. Its a very small space telescope, but its got some very unique features. Ellis says this rich dataset will allow serendipitous discoveries. Its likely to find the unexpected, he says. Voyage across the galaxy and beyond with our space newsletter every month. The infrared data, outside the range of human vision, will allow scientists to determine how far away objects are and learn about how galaxies form and evolve. It can also be used to determine the chemical make-up of objects, potentially revealing the presence of water and other key ingredients for life. Anything interesting thrown up by SPHEREx can then be investigated in a more focused way using NASAs existing space telescope fleet, including the ageing but powerful Hubble Space Telescope and the newer James Webb Space Telescope JWST. Christopher Conselice at the University of Manchester, UK, says SPHEREx wont match the resolution of JWST or produce similarly awe-inspiring images, but it will be a workhorse for scientific discovery. JWST has the potential to point at one part of the sky, take some big pictures and reveal something completely new. And SPHEREx wont be able to really do the same thing, he says. Its going to be an analysis thats going to take years and its going to cover the sky many, many times. SPHEREx will orbit Earth 14.5 times a day, facing away from the planets surface, and complete 11,000 orbits in its two-year lifespan. Three cone-shaped shields will protect its instruments against interference from the radiant heat of Earth and the sun. Launching on the same rocket will be another NASA mission, Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere PUNCH, which will study the suns solar wind.

Editors have highlighted the following attributes while ensuring the contents credibility fact-checked trusted source proofread by European Space Agency High-resolution near-infrared light captured by the NASAESACSA James Webb Space Telescope shows extraordinary new detail and structure in Lynds 483 L483. Two actively forming stars are responsible for the shimmering ejections of gas and dust that gleam in orange, blue, and purple in this representative color image. Over tens of thousands of years, the central protostars have periodically ejected some of the gas and dust, spewing it out as tight, fast jets and slightly slower outflows that trip across space. When more recent ejections hit older ones, the material can crumple and twirl based on the densities of what is colliding. Over time, chemical reactions within these ejections and the surrounding cloud have produced a range of molecules, like carbon monoxide, methanol, and several other organic compounds. The two protostars responsible for this scene are at the center of the hourglass shape, in an opaque horizontal disk of cold gas and dust that fits within a single pixel. Much farther out, above and below the flattened disk where dust is thinner, the bright light from the stars shines through the gas and dust, forming large semi-transparent orange cones. Its equally important to notice where the stars light is blockedlook for the exceptionally dark, wide V-shapes offset by 90 degrees from the orange cones. These areas may look like there is no material, but its actually where the surrounding dust is the densest, and little starlight penetrates it. If you look carefully at these areas, Webbs sensitive NIRCam Near-Infrared Camera has picked up distant stars as muted orange pinpoints behind this dust. Where the view is free of obscuring dust, stars shine brightly in white and blue. Some of the stars jets and outflows have wound up twisted or warped. To find examples, look toward the top right edge where theres a prominent orange arc. This is a shock front, where the stars ejections were slowed by existing, denser material. Now, look a little lower, where orange meets pink. Here, the material looks like a tangled mess. These are new, incredibly fine details Webb has revealed, and will require detailed study to explain. Turn to the lower half. Here, the gas and dust appear thicker. Zoom in to find tiny light purple pillars. They point toward the central stars nonstop winds, and formed because the material within them is dense enough that it hasnt yet been blown away. L483 is too large to fit in a single Webb snapshot, and this image was taken to fully capture the upper section and outflows, which is why the lower section is only partially shown. All the symmetries and asymmetries in these clouds may eventually be explained as researchers reconstruct the history of the stars ejections, in part by updating models to produce the same effects. Astronomers will also eventually calculate how much material the stars have expelled, which molecules were created when material smashed together, and how dense each area is. Millions of years from now, when the stars are finished forming, they may each be about the mass of our sun. Their outflows will have cleared the areasweeping away these semi-transparent ejections. All that may remain is a tiny disk of gas and dust where planets may eventually form. L483 is named for American astronomer Beverly T. Lynds, who published extensive catalogues of dark and bright nebulae in the early 1960s. She did this by carefully examining photographic plates which preceded film of the first Palomar Observatory Sky Survey, accurately recording each objects coordinates and characteristics. These catalogues provided astronomers with detailed maps of dense dust clouds where stars formcritical resources for the astronomical community decades before the first digital files became available and access to the internet was widespread.

These stars periodically eject gas and dust, creating jets and outflows that interact with older material, forming complex structures. Chemical reactions within these ejections have produced various molecules. The protostars are surrounded by dense dust, blocking some starlight, while other areas allow light to form semi-transparent cones. The image shows twisted jets and dense pillars, indicating ongoing dynamic processes. Over millions of years, the stars may clear the surrounding area, leaving a disk where planets could form.

Payment for publication is made by the authors institutions or funding bodies, who pay an Article Processing Charge APC when the manuscript is accepted. From January 2021, authors submitting primary research articles to Nature are able to choose to publish their work either through the traditional subscription publishing route OR gold Open Access. Non-primary research articles e.g. Reviews, Comments, News  Views should not include original previously unpublished research findings and may only contain minimal new supporting data. These non-primary articles are not eligible for gold Open Access and can only be published using the traditional subscription-based publishing route. Find out more about publishing in Nature. Authors may need to take specific actions to achieve compliance with funder and institutional open access mandates. If your research is supported by a funder that requires immediate open access e.g. according to Plan S principles then you should select the gold OA route, and we will direct you to the compliant route where possible. For authors selecting the subscription publication route, the journals standard licensing terms will need to be accepted, including self-archiving policies. Those licensing terms will supersede any other terms that the author or any third party may assert apply to any version of the manuscript.

Microsoft unveiled its Majorana 1 quantum chip in February.Credit John Brecher for Microsoft A physicist has cast doubt on a test that underlies a high-profile claim by Microsoft to have created the first topological qubits, a long-sought goal of the companys quantum computing effort. The critique comes amid mounting speculation about the validity of Microsofts claim. Microsoft announced the breakthrough, which could lead to a quantum computer more resistant to information loss than with other approaches, on 19 February. Without a peer-reviewed paper backing up the claim, some researchers were sceptical. An accompanying paper in Nature described a method to measure the read-out from future topological qubits, but did not offer proof of their existence1. While the Nature paper outlined our approach, it does not speak to our progress, a Microsoft spokesperson said in a statement. The paper was submitted almost a year before it was published and since then tremendous progress has occurred, they said. Natures news team is independent of its journals team. In the latest critique, posted as a preprint2, Henry Legg, a theoretical physicist at the University of St Andrews, UK, raises concerns about a test that Microsoft uses to look for Majoranas, so-far undiscovered quasiparticles arising from the collective behaviour of electrons that are needed for the topological qubits to work. Known as the topological gap protocol TGP, the test is not mentioned in the 19 February Microsoft announcement. But the company has subsequently indicated to Natures news team, and in a comment online, that it created the topological qubits using the TGP. Since the TGP is flawed, the very foundations of the qubit are not there, says Legg. Chetan Nayak, a theoretical physicist leading Microsofts quantum computing effort in Redmond, Washington, stands by the qubit claim. The criticism can be summarized as Legg constructing a false straw man of our paper and then attacking that, he says. Majoranas have previously proved elusive. Several claimed sightings later proved to be Majorana mimics, in some cases leading to retractions. In 2022, Microsoft researchers posted a preprint reporting that the TGP could indirectly identify Majoranas with high probability the preprint was later published in Physical Review B PRB3. The test relies on electronic measurements of microscopic sandwiches of ultracold metal. If the measurement exhibits a specific feature characteristic of Majoranas, the device passes and is said to host the elusive particles. Legg and his colleagues at the University of Basel in Switzerland went on to report that the test could be fooled by false positives, doppelgangers with the electronic features of Majoranas that lacked their useful properties4. In his latest critique, Legg reports further flaws with the protocol. Examining data in the PRB paper, he saw large variations in the external conditions, such as the range of magnetic field strengths, when electronic measurements were taken. The test was designed to measure the intrinsic properties of the device  and thus whether it contained Majoranas. Instead, Legg found that varying conditions made the test an inconsistent weathervane. Nayak does not accept this criticism. The ranges come from an initial scan we describe, and we always analyze the full data, he says. Another problem, says Legg, is that a key parameter in the code that implements the protocol, which Microsoft shared publicly, differs from the description in the PRB paper. When asked by Natures news team about the issue, Nayak said Legg claims theres a difference between our described protocol and the implemented code. This is incorrect, so this is a non-issue. Legg says that Nayak previously acknowledged this difference in an e-mail to him and planned to issue a correction, but changed his mind. Leggs critique is certainly valid, says Carlo Beenakker, a theoretical physicist at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands, although he remains enthusiastic about Microsofts goal of creating topological qubits. I have a deep respect for people who basically go out and somehow are not distracted by others who say, I dont believe it, he says. Anton Akhmerov, a theoretical physicist at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, says that Leggs critique requires a public response from the Microsoft researchers. A Microsoft spokesperson said that they would officially respond to Leggs critique when contacted by editors of PRB. A better understanding may be hiding in the data. The Microsoft researchers who authored the PRB paper kept some details back, citing intellectual-property concerns  including the code underlying simulations used to verify the protocol. An accompanying editorial acknowledged that this was not in accordance with the usual norms of the Physical Review journals and that the authors would release further details by the end of 2024. Microsoft sent Natures news team some of the device parameters. Akhmerov says this is not enough information. The validity of the Microsoft result cannot be established without reviewing the source code of their simulations, he says. The recent Nature paper does not clear up matters. A Nature spokesperson says that the journal is aware of the concerns about the protocol, and that the validity of the Nature paper was not affected by those concerns. More should be revealed on 18 March, when Nayak is due to give a talk on Microsofts topological qubit data at the American Physical Society meeting in Anaheim, California. In the meantime, theres no convincing, even mildly convincing, evidence for Majoranas, Beenakker says. doi httpsdoi.org10.1038d41586-025-00683-2 Microsoft Azure Quantum. Nature 638, 651655 2025.

Resilience at work isnt about wearing a suit of armour, but instead about learning when to persist and when to pivot.Credit Getty More than a decade ago, palaeoceanographer Summer Praetorius received some bad news her mother had brain cancer. Praetorius was deep in her graduate studies at Oregon State University in Corvallis, but she somehow managed to juggle her mothers care with her demanding workload. But in just a few short months, Praetoriuss mother died. In the aftermath, Praetorius seemed like a picture of resilience to her colleagues as she continued to work and go to lectures. But beneath the surface she was torn between her grief and her desire to keep going with her graduate studies. The only way she felt she could stay on top of the demands of her studies was to shelve her emotions. I often wanted to quit because I felt so run down and threadbare, says Praetorius, who is now at the US Geological Survey in Menlo Park, California. But there wasnt really the option. How a lupus diagnosis taught me that resilience in science is a double-edged sword How a lupus diagnosis taught me that resilience in science is a double-edged sword Praetoriuss experience captures academias often misguided view of resilience  the ability to adapt and overcome challenges or adversity. Academia isnt the only environment that encourages people to put on a brave face when the going gets tough  other workplaces show a similar cultural tendency. Theres no doubt that resilience is a necessary skill for dealing with the inevitable failure, rejection and fierce competition that comes with building a research career. Some institutions, including the US National Institutes of Health NIH and Imperial College London, are running courses that aim to help researchers to develop the resilience needed to navigate tough career challenges and maintain their well-being. But some researchers say that the culture of academia is perpetuating harmful misconceptions about resilience, such as implying that researchers should tough it out in a toxic environment. Others think that institutions need to do more to address systemic problems  such as low pay and a lack of inclusivity  before they place the onus on researchers to always weather the storm. Instead of teaching people to dodge stones that we have thrown at them, it would be better not to throw stones from the very beginning, says Roman Zviagintsev, an educational-equality researcher at the University of Vienna. A simple definition of resilience is that when something bad happens, it doesnt derail you, says David Yeager, a psychologist at the University of Texas at Austin. But this view has its limitations and underlies a lot of myths about resilience, such as equating it with suppressing negative emotions, adds Yeager. That approach, he says, often makes matters worse in the long run. Its a very poor emotion-regulation strategy, says Yeager. Another harmful myth is that resilience is about continuing to work in environments in which inequity, disparity and bullying are rife, says Paul Seldon, a pharmacologist who runs an academic-resilience workshop at Imperial College Londons Early Career Research Institute ECRI. The expectation to live up to this version of resilience is familiar to Emily Wharton, a biomechanics researcher at Liverpool John Moores University, UK. On International Womens Day in 2023, Wharton gave a presentation to her department about the issues students were facing regarding inclusivity, along with her own experiences. But a senior male colleague dismissed her concerns and struggled to understand where she was coming from. Although some other senior colleagues were supportive afterwards, most of them advised her not to share too much about her personal experiences. I got told that I need to toughen up if I want to be in this world, says Wharton. Basically  I need to change, rather than there being a shift in other peoples behaviour or the wider system, she says. Palaeoceanographer Summer Praetorius advises researchers to prioritize themselves during tough times.Credit USGS But true resilience isnt about wearing a suit of armour to work or persisting with goals at the expense of mental health. Instead, its about making calm, intentioned decisions in the face of setback and disappointment, says Sharon Milgram, a biomedical researcher who heads the NIHs Office of Intramural Training and Education OITE in Bethesda, Maryland. This often means setting boundaries and learning to say no to unreasonable demands or requests that dont match a researchers values, she says. It is the ability to know when to persist and when to pivot, says Milgram. Communication barriers for a Deaf PhD student meant risking burnout Communication barriers for a Deaf PhD student meant risking burnout For instance, an early-career researcher might continue working with a bully who is an influential principal investigator because they see them as a necessary stepping stone in their career. But in this case, finding a way out of this toxic situation is healthier than sticking it out and putting up with abuse, say interviewees. Resilience also isnt a fixed trait that people are born with, but a skill that is developed and practised over time see How to become resilient, the healthy way, says Dusana Dorjee, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of York, UK. A big part of building resilience involves reflecting on challenges rather than reacting to them, as well as considering failures as opportunities to learn. These are habits that need to be developed all the time, so they are there when adversity strikes, she says. Shift your mindset. Its easy to fall prey to negative self-talk after a big grant rejection or failed experiment. But reframing thoughts to focus on what can be learnt from the experience can help you to bounce back sooner, says Diane Safer, who heads graduate career and professional development at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City. Instead of saying, Im really not good at that, its changing your mindset and saying, Im not good at that yet, says Safer. Be assertive. Contrary to popular belief, resilience isnt about powering through challenges with superhuman strength and accommodating every demand, says Sharon Milgram, a biomedical researcher who heads the National Institutes of Healths Office of Intramural Training and Education in Bethesda, Maryland. Its about developing the assertiveness to set boundaries, say no and ask for help. It isnt suffering because were supposed to work hard, says Milgram. Its making sure we are doing something that brings us joy and value. Remember your why. Although academia prizes prestige, publications and metrics, having a strong sense of purpose often has a more positive effect on mental health, says Dusana Dorjee, a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of York, UK. If you think about the purpose of science, it is about supporting the greater good and contributing knowledge, says Dorjee. Thats the primary drive, rather than awards. Build your connections. Developing resilience doesnt just depend on individual effort. It also comes down to having strong social connections and support, which can help researchers to maintain their self-confidence and adaptability, says Paul Seldon, a cell biologist who runs an academic-resilience workshop at Imperial College Londons Early Career Research Institute. Its recognizing the need to be emotionally connected, beyond social media, having a worklife balance and accepting help, says Seldon. One mental habit that can help to build genuine resilience is viewing stress as something that can aid performance rather than a bad thing to be avoided at all costs, says Yeager. A 2022 study led by Yeager that involved almost 3,000 US school students found that students who took part in a 30-minute online course on various mindsets about stress  such as it being a sign of challenge rather than incompetence  had lower stress levels when performing a task under pressure than did a control group1. Resilience isnt just a lie you tell yourself, says Yeager. You actually need to reframe key experiences. Building such habits is the focus of the NIH OITEs resilience-training programme, a five-part series of lectures and discussion groups that was originally developed in 2020 to help biomedical scientists through the COVID-19 pandemic, says Milgram, who leads the programme. It covers topics such as self-talk, which is a persons internal dialogue, assertiveness and how to handle feedback. A 2025 study2 on the programmes effectiveness found that participants scored higher on resilience and lower on stress and anxiety after they took part in the series compared with before. Defying the stereotype of Black resilience Defying the stereotype of Black resilience Although such courses are a step in the right direction, they should not replace efforts to tackle systemic inequities, says Caitlin Aamodt, a neuroscientist at the University of California, San Diego. She adds that institutions shouldnt expect resilience to look the same for everyone and that an individuals circumstances need to be considered. The best path might not be the original path, says Aamodt. Finding the joy and excitement in her research was key to staying the course after she was diagnosed with lupus  an autoimmune disease that causes debilitating symptoms such as extreme fatigue, joint pain and fever. If that hadnt been true, I dont think it would have made sense for me to continue, says Aamodt. Dorjee adds that fostering resilience isnt just down to the individual, but also to the environment they work in. For instance, a workplace that is focused solely on achievement, metrics and beating the competition can undermine mental health and a researchers capacity to be resilient. A 2024 survey3 of more than 2,000 PhD and masters students in the United States found that unreasonable expectations and harsh criticism can worsen anxiety and depression symptoms. But taking steps to create a more supportive environment  such as including regular check-ins to see whether laboratory members need help, and encouraging researchers to remember the bigger purpose behind their work  can make it easier to adapt to setbacks and challenges, says Dorjee. In 2021, OITE created another resilience-training series for faculty members, staff scientists and administrators who want to foster resilience in themselves and in the early-career researchers they mentor. Creating a culture of resilience can include using language that is affirming and helps students to reframe setbacks, such as reminding them that everyone makes mistakes, says Milgram. Its also about creating an inclusive environment and learning how to deliver feedback more mindfully. Its not about coddling people, its about supporting them to excel in a rigorous environment, she says. When the going gets tough, Praetorius advises researchers to uphold their values, remember whats most important in their lives and prioritize their health. I think thats the only sustainable route to true resilience, she says. doi httpsdoi.org10.1038d41586-025-00383-x Yeager, D. S. et al. Nature 607, 512520 2022. Article PubMed Google Scholar Han, H.
